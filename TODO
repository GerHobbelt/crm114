CRM114 TODO list, targetted at build and distribution issues. TODO: merge in
Bill's docs/things_to_do.txt , which is more about CRM114 proper.

- Make sure this file gets installed.

- make sure manpage for crm114(1) is up to date.  Possibly write crmcss(5).
  Write crmmailfilter(1).  Remove now-duplicate stuff from README, FAQ,
  CRM114_Mailfilter_HOWTO.txt, QUICKREF.

- decide on wether or not shipping lib TRE tarball with this one
  * ./configure should do something sane in absence of libtre.
    Currently (2004-01-14) it falls back to using glibc regexp.
    This, however, should be fully stresstested.
  * test wether we catch errors of missing LD_LIBRARY_PATH: the
    broken-run-time test in configure should work.
  * these things might be solved by using pkg-config:
    as Ville Laurikari wrote dd Sat, 3 Jan 2004 16:07:01 +0200:
 The best way
 to handle linking to TRE is of course to use pkg-config and autoconf:
 .
  PKG_CHECK_MODULES(TRE, tre >= 0.6.4)
 .
 This will check that at least version 0.6.4 of TRE is installed.  If
 found, it will define the TRE_LIBS and TRE_CFLAGS substitution
 variables which can be used for compiling and linking stuff against
 TRE.  If the package does not exist, reasonable error messages are
 shown.
 I'd recommend to use this in the autoconfiscated version of crm114.  I
 haven't tried for a while if the .pc files work, so be prepared for
 problems :)

- list mailing list address in documentation

- get rid of stuff in cvs/sf/crm114/tools , or, at least minize it: keep
  diff with Bill's tarball minimal.

- learn Bill how to build tarball on his system, using autotools

- set up a cvs-commit mailing list, get commit messages sent there.

- Add tip from Stefan Seyfried on how to invoke mailfilter as a pure filter
  to CRM114_Mailfilter_HOWTO.txt:

ok. Again my hack from my .procmailrc:

---------------------bite here---------------------------------
CRMSCORE=`$HOME/bin/crmstats.sh`

:0fw: .formail.crm114.lock
  | formail -I "X-CRM114-Score: $CRMSCORE"
---------------------bite here---------------------------------

~/bin/crmstats.sh is a simple script:
---------------------bite here---------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
grep -a -v "^X-CRM114" | \
  /usr/bin/crm -u /home/seife/.crm114 mailfilter.crm --stats_only
---------------------bite here---------------------------------

This inserts exactly one line, "X-CRM114-Score: " with the pR rating on
which my mua (mutt) matches and highlights mails. Of course procmail could
deal with the negative classified mails, but it is only a matter of two
keypresses to auto-tag and move them away so i did not bother.

- JvB: stop hacking on CRM114 at february 19, 2004: my time is precious.

- make sure autoconfiscated CRM114 works out-of-the box on Bill's platform.
  Optionally: on FreeBSD, on Mac OSX.
  This CRM114 branch is reported to run on OpenBSD (3.3),
  Debian GNU/Linux (woody, dec 2003 sid), Red Hat Linux 7.2 and Sun Solaris (9).

  (Easily test in homedirectory doing:

   wget http://laurikari.net/tre/tre-0.6.3.tar.gz
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local && make && make install
   wget http://mdcc.cx/~joostvb/crm114/auto/crm114-20031219-RC12.6.tar.gz
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:$HOME/local/lib ./configure \
    LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/local/include \
    --prefix=$HOME/opt/crm114 && make && make install
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:$HOME/local/lib
   ~/opt/crm114/bin/crm114

  )

- mailfilter should work out of the box, without copying large chunks of
  code to one's homedirectory.  User configuration should be supported, in
  $HOME/ .
  * mailfilter.crm should get renamed to crmfilter, installed in /usr/bin/
  * once include path issues are resolved, decide on e.g. ~/.crmfilter/ .

- configure ideally should support choosing between _3_ regexp libs.  Not
  just TRE and libc GNU regex.  E.g. configure --with-tre|gnu|rx
  * gnu-regex: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/regex/regex-0.12.tar.gz , now shipped as a
  part of GNU C library.  See also
  libregex0 - GNU regular expression library, run time libraries. [libc5]
  glibc seems to ship regex from Isamu Hasegawa since 2.3.
  * rx: http://www.netsw.org/system/libs/regex/ , ship rx-1.9a ( 07-Jun-1998 )
  and later.  ftp.gnu.org  has rx-1.5.tar.gz. (Oct 31  1998)
  * rxspencer-alpha3.8.g2.tar.gz (12-Sep-2002) Henry Spencers implementation
  of the POSIX.2 regex(3) library, http://arglist.com/regex/
  ftp://zoo.toronto.edu/pub/regex.shar http://www.netsw.org/system/libs/regex/
  Debian manpages package ships a regex(7) manpage taken from Henry Spencerâ€™s
  regex package.

- configure.ac could better use pkg-config, see comments in the file.

- megatest.sh should work out of the box, _after_ installation.
  I'd be nice to have a ``make test'' run this, _before_ installation.

  (DONE: GerH -- split up megatest into particles in tests/ + make check; there's
   also make megatest / make megatest_ng for those that love the old ways.)

- C sources should have

  #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
  #include "config.h"
  #endif

  (DONE: GerH)

- document how to have both a /usr/bin/crm114-tre and a /usr/bin/crm114-rx
  installed: ./configure --program-suffix ; cd src ; make install .

- refer to Peter Popovich's RPM in docs. (.spec is gone): point to
  http://popovich.net/crm114/

- add link to http://camram.sourceforge.net/ .

- migrate malloc/calloc/free/strdup/etc. to crm_malloc(..., error_reason_message)
  (basic routines have been set up in crm_str_funcs.c) and make sure no intern
  can ever use malloc/realloc/etc. ever again -- this to ensure each allocation
  is checked and duely reported.

- make the AX_* M4 macros work again - currently optimizations are disabled on UNIX
  do to one of these.

- See if we can find a better solution for the crm_free() void** casting and the
  GCC 3.x resulting warning in -O3 mode about type-punning. :-(

- make VT <unique> / oridering cooperate with feature_weight/order_no fetching
  classifiers & Arne's optimization: right now, those extra values are *SHOT*
  when <unique> is specified.
