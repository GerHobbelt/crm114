# Vanilla CRM114 fails on this code: see the comment
#

window
isolate (:a:) /x/
output /a = ':*:a:'\n/		# expected: a = 'x'

isolate (:a:) //
output /a = ':*:a:'\n/		# expected: a = ''
# ^^^^ VANILLA CRM114 gives: a = 'x'
# i.e. '//' is treated as '<default> //' within its 'isolate' code.

# Same error for GerH builds before BlameBarack release!
