STDERR TEST OUTPUT:

crm114: *UNTRAPPABLE ERROR*

Better start screaming, guv', since the software's just gone critical:
assertion '!(scale <= 1.19209290e-7F && scale >= -1.19209290e-7F)' failed!
Sorry, but this program is very sick and probably should be killed off.
This happened at line 3 of file (from command line):
    clump [:one_paragraph:] <bychunk> (i_test.css) /[[:graph:]]+/
