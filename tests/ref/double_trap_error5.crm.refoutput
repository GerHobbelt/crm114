Double Trap: Trap Pattern Expansion Problem in TRAP pattern ':bogus' while processing the trappable error 'YO! YA!': 
crm114: *WARNING*
 This expansion eval didn't end with a ':' which is often an error...  Check it sometime?
I'll try to keep working.

Sorry, but this program is very sick and probably should be killed off.
