STDOUT TEST OUTPUT:

Start of insert processor testing 
 start here ... the first middle bit...  the really middle-middle bit ... the last middle bit...  and the last bit of normal text 
now we test nonexistent file overrides 
this should not cause a FATAL ERROR, because we trap it.
We caught the nonexistent file fault here.  Message was:
 <<start of msg>>
Couldn't insert the file named 'there_is_no_such_file_as_this.txt' that you asked for.  This is probably a bad thing.
 <<end of msg>> 
via the TRAP
End of insert testing.
