testing <absent> versus binding  (the '67' bug)
  The next stmt --- SHOULD--- get an error message! 
 Caught the error, fault text was: 

crm114: *WARNING*
 This program specifies an 'absent' match, and also tries to bind variables that, by the above, aren't matched!   We'll ignore these variable bindings for now.
I'll try to keep working.
This happened at line 293 of file matchtest.crm:
    match <absent> (:incognita:) /nothinjkljiejfksn;s94jf94msks/
(runtime system location: crm_expr_match.c(506) in routine: crm_expr_match)
