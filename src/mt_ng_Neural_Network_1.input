You can use CRM114 flags on the shell-standard invocation line, and
hide them with '--' from the program itself; '--' incidentally prevents
the invoking user from changing any CRM114 invocation flags.

Flags should be located after any positional variables on the command
line.  Flags _are_ visible as :_argN: variables, so you can create
your own flags for your own programs (separate CRM114 and user flags
with '--').
