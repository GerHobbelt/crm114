-----  THE COMMAND LINE -------------

Invoke as 'crm whatever' or use '#!/usr/bin/crm' as the first line
of a script file containing the program text.

  -d N   - run N cycles, then drop into debugger.  If no N, debug immediately
  -e     - no environment variables imported
  -E     - set engine runtime exit base value 
  -h     - print help text
  -l N   - print a listing (detail level 1 through 5)
  -p     - generate an execution-time-spent profile on exit
  -P N   - max program lines
  -q m   - default mathmode (0,1 = alg/RPN in EVAL, 2,3 = alg/RPN everywhere)
  -s N   - new feature file (.css) size is N (default 1 meg+1 featureslots)
  -S N   - new feature file (.css) size is N rounded up to 2^I+1 featureslots
  -t     - prettyprint source listing & give user level execution trace output 
  -T     - implementors trace output (only for the masochistic!)
  -u dir - chdir to directory dir before starting execution 
  -v     - print CRM114 version identification and exit.
  -w N   - max data window (bytes, default 16 megs)
  --     - signals the end CRM114 flags; prior flags are not seen by 
	   the user program; subsequent args are not processed by CRM114.
  --foo  - creates the user variable :foo: with the value SET
  --x=y  - creates the user variable :x: with the value y	   
  -{ stmts }  - execute the statements inside the {} brackets.

Absent the -{ program } flag, the first arg is taken to be the name of
a file containing a crm114 program, subsequent args are merely supplied
as :_argN: values.  Use single quotes around commandline programs 
'-{ like this }' to prevent the shell from doing odd things to your
command-line programs.  

CRM114 can be directly invoked by the shell if the first line of your
program file uses the shell standard, as in:

	#! /usr/bin/crm

You can use CRM114 flags on the shell-standard invocation line, and
hide them with '--' from the program itself; '--' incidentally prevents
the invoking user from changing any CRM114 invocation flags.

Flags should be located after any positional variables on the command
line.  Flags _are_ visible as :_argN: variables, so you can create
your own flags for your own programs (separate CRM114 and user flags
with '--').  

Examples:

   ./foo.crm bar mugga < baz  -t -w 150000      <--- Use this

   ./foo.crm -t -w 1500000 -- bar < baz mugga   <--- or this 

   ./foo.crm -t -w 150000 bar < baz mugga      <--- NOT like this


You can put a list of user-settable vars on the '#!/usr/bin/crm'
invocation line.  CRM114 will print these out when a program is
invoked directly (e.g. "./myprog.crm -h", not "crm myprog.crm -h")
with the -h (for help) flag.  (note that this works ONLY on Linux and
Darwin - FreeBSD and Solaris have a different implementations and this
doesn't work.  Don't use this in programs that need to be portable)

Example:
 
#!/usr/bin/crm  -( var1 var2=A var2=B var2=C )

			- allows only var1 and var2 be set on the
                          command line.  If a variable is not assigned
                          a value, the user can set any value desired.
                          If the variable is equated to a set of
                          values, those are the _only_ values allowed.

#!/usr/bin/crm  -( var1 var2=foo )  --    

		        - allows var1 to be set to any value, var2 may
                          only be set to either "foo" or not at all,
                          and no other variables may be set nor may
                          invocation flags be changed (because of the
                          trailing "--").  Since "--" also blocks '-h'
                          for help, such programs should provide their
                          own help facility.

----- VARIABLES ----------

Variable names and locations start with a : , end with a : , and may
contain only characters that have ink (i.e. the [:graph:] class) with
a few exceptions- basically, no embedded ':' characters.  They are case
sensitive.

Examples :here: , :ThErE:, :every-where_0123+45%6789: , 
:this_is_a_very_very_long_var_name_that_does_not_tell_us_much: .
  
Builtin variables: 
	  :_nl: - newline
	  :_ht: - horizontal tab
	  :_bs: - backspace
	  :_sl: - a slash
	  :_sc: - a semicolon
	  :_arg0: thru :_argN: - command-line args, including _all_ flags
	  :_argc: - how many command line arguments there were
	  :_pos0: thru :_posN: - positional args ('-' or '--' args deleted)
	  :_posc: - how many positional arguments there were
	  :_pos_str:  - all positional arguments concatented
          :_env_whatever: - environment value 'whatever'
	  :_env_string:  - all environmental arguments concatenated
	  :_crm_version: - the version of the CRM system
	  :_cd: - the current call depth
	  :_cs: - the current statement number
	  :_pgm_hash: - hash of the current program - for version verification
	  :_pgm_text: - copy of post-processed source code - matchable 
	  :_pid: - process ID of the current process.
	  :_ppid: - process ID of the parent of the current process.
	  :_dw: - the current data window contents (usually the default arg)
	  :_iso: - the current isolated data block (change at your own peril!)

----  VARIABLE EXPANSION  ----

You can use the standard C char constant '\' characters, such as "\n"
for newline, as well as excaped hexadecimal and octal characters like
\xHH and \oOOO but these are constants, not variables, and cannot be
redefined.

Variables are expanded by the ':*:' var-expansion operator,
e.g. :*:_nl: expands to a newline character.  Uninitialized vars
evaluate to their text name (and the colons stay).  User variables
are also expanded with the :*: operator, so :*:foo: expands to whatever
value :foo: has. 

Variables are indirected by the :+: indirection operator; the reason
for the :+: operator is that if :foo: contains the name of another
variable (such as might happen in a CALL statement), then :*: would
only return the name of that other variable, but :+: would return the
value in that other variable.  Use :+: and :*:_cd: to get proper isolation
in non-tail-recursive variables, like :+:foo_:*:_cd:: to get the value of
a recursively labeled foo_0, foo_1, foo_2, etc.

Depending on the value of "math mode" (flag -q). you can also use
:#:string_or_var: to get the length of a string, and :@:string_or_var:
to do basic mathematics and inequality testing, either only in EVALs
or for all var-expanded expressions.  See "Sequence of Evaluation"
below for more details.


-----  PROGRAM BEHAVIOR  ----

Default behavior is to read all of standard input till EOF into the
default data window (named :_dw:), then execute the program (this is
overridden if first executable statement is a WINDOW stmt).

Variables don't get their own storage unless you ISOLATE them (see
below), instead variables are start/length pairs indexing into the
default data window.  Thus, ALTERing an unISOLATEd variable changes
the value of the default data buffer itself.  This is a great power,
so use it only for good, and never for evil.



--- STATEMENTS AND STUFF (separate statements with a ';' or with a newline) --

 \      - '\' is the string-text escape character.  You only _need_ to
           escape the literal representation of closing delimiters
           inside var-expanded arguments.

           You can use the classic C/C++ \-escapes, such as \n, \r,
           \t, \a, \b, \v, \f, \0, for the ASCII-defined escape
           sequences, and also \xHH and \oOOO for hex and octal
           characters, respectively.

           A '\' as the _last_ character of a line means the next line
           is just a continuation of this one.

           A \-escape that isn't recognized as something special isn't
           an error; you may _optionally_ escape any of these delimiters:

                         > ) ] } ; / # \

           and get just that character.

           A '\' anywhere else is just a literal backslash, so the regex
           ([abc])\1 is written just that way; there is no need to
           double-backslash the \1 (although it will work if you do).  This
	   is because the first backslash escapes the second backslash,
	   so only one backslash is "seen" at runtime.


# this is a comment

# and this too \#        - A comment is not a piece of preprocessor sugar-
                      it is a -statement- and ends at the newline or at "\#"


insert filename                   - inserts the file verbatim at this
				    line at compile time.  If the file
				    can't be INSERTed, a system-generated
                                    FAULT statement is inserted.  Use a TRAP
				    to catch this fault if you want to
                                    allow program execution to continue 
                                    without the missing INSERT file.
       filename			     - the local (-u applied) file to insert
       [expanded_filename]           - the filename is first expanded against 
                                       command-line and environment variables.


  ;                               - semicolon is a statement separator - 
                                    unless it's inside delimiters
				    it must be escaped as \; or else
				    it _will_ mark the end of the
				    statement.


{ and }                           - start and end blocks of
                                    statements. Must always be '\'
                                    escaped or inside delimiters or
                                    these will mark the start/end of a
                                    block.


noop			          - no-op statement


:label:                           - define a GOTOable label 

:label: (:arg:)			  - define a CALLable label.  The args in
				    the CALL statement are concatenated and
				    put into the freshly ISOLATEd var :arg:
   (:arg:)                         - var-expanded varname to recieve the
				     caller's arguments (usually a MATCH is
				     then done to put locally convenient 
				     labels on the args).


accept			          - writes the current data window to standard 
                                    output; execution continues.


alius				  - if the last bracket-group succeeded, ALIUS
				    skips to end of {} block (a skip, not a 
                                    FAIL); if the prior group FAILed,
				    ALIUS does nothing.  Thus, ALIUS is both 
				    an ELSE clause and a CASE statement.  


alter (:var:) /new-val/           - surgically change value of var to newval
      (:var:)                       - var to change (var-expanded)
              /new-val/             - value to change to (var-expanded)


call /:entrypoint_label:/ [:arg1: :arg2:... ] (:ret_arg:) 
                                  do a routine call on the	
				  specified (var-expanded) entrypoint label.
				  Note that the called routine shares 
				  all variables (including the data window
				  :_dw:).  Return is accomplished with the
				  RETURN statement.  
     /:entrypoint_label:/         - the location to call
       [:arg1: :arg2: ...]       - var-expanded list of args to call.
                                   These are concatenated and supplied
                                   to the called routine as a single
                                   ISOLATEd var, to be used as desired
                                   (usually a MATCH parses the arglist
                                   as desired, then :*: is used for
                                   call-by-value arguments, and :+:
                                   indirection is used to retrieve
                                   call-by-name arguments).  Call-by-value
                                   arguments are NOT modifiable by the
				   callee, while call-by-name arguments
				   are modifiable.
        (:ret_arg:)              - this variable gets the returned value
                                   from the routine called (if it returns
                                   anything).  If it had a previous value,
                                   that value is overwritten on return.

classify <flags> (:c1:...|...:cN:) (:stats:) [:in:] /word-pat/ /pR_offset/
				- compare the statistics of the current data
				  window buffer with classfiles c1...cN .
                                  In general, class statistics files are
                                  NOT portable between different classifiers!
      <nocase>                  - ignore case in word-pat, does not
			          ignore case in actual text (use tr()
				  or the TRANSLATE command 
				  to do that on :in: if you want it)   
      <microgroom>              - enable the microgroomer to purge
                                  less-important information automatically
                                  whenever the statistics file gets to
                                  crowded.  However, this disables certain 
                                  optimizations that can speed classification.
      <unique>                  - use unique features only; this improves
                                  accuracy while using less memory.
                                  Usable with Markov and OSB modes.
      <unigram>			- use single-word features only;  his makes 
                                  CRM114 almost exactly equivalent to most 
                                  other Bayesian classifiers.  Works with 
                                  the OSB, Winnow and hyperspace classifiers.
      <osb>			- use orthogonal sparse bigram (OSB)
                                  features and Markovian classification
                                  instead of Markovian SBPH features.
				  OSB uses a subset of SBPH featuers 
				  with about 1/4 the memory and disk needs,
				  and about 4x the speed of full Markovian,
				  with basically the same accuracy.
      <osbf>                    - use the Fidelis Confidence Factor 
                                  local probability generator.  This
                                  format is not compatible with the default,
                                  but with singlesided threshold training
                                  ( typically pR of 10-30 ) achieves the best 
                                  accuracy yet.
      <winnow>                  - use the Winnow nonstatistical classifier
                                  and the OSB frontend feature generator.
                                  Winnow uses .cow files, which are not 
                                  compatible with the .css files for 
                                  the Markovian (default) and OSB classifers.
      <hyperspace>              - use hyperspace matching; each learned 
                                  document represents a light source in a
                                  4-billion-dimensional hyperspace, and the 
                                  set of sources that shines most brightly onto
                                  the unknown document's hyperspatial location
                                  is the matching class.  EXPERIMENTAL!!!
      <entropy>                 - use the bit-entropy classifier.  This uses
                                  compressibility of the unknown given the 
                                  prior learned text as a perfect compressor
                                  model.  No tokenization happens- this 
                                  classifier works one bit at a time, always.  
                                  EXPERIMENTAL !!!
      <svm>                     - use the SVM classifier.  This uses SVM 
                                  (support vector machine) techniques.  NB:
                                  for now VERY EXPERIMENTAL; OSB or unigram
                                  features (default OSB features), 
                                  2-class only, generates A_vs_B files.
      <sks>                     - use the String Kernel SVM.  String kernels
                                  take one character at a time as token 
                                  features, but don't use omitted subsections
                                  like the OSB feature set.  VERY EXPERIMENTAL.
                                  2-class only, generates A_vs_B files.
      <neural>                  - use a three-layer neural network with 
                                  stochastic back-propagation training.  
                                  Use <fromstart> to reinitialize the network
                                  neurons to a small random state in case it
                                  gets stuck in a (rare) local minimum.
                                  Use <bychunk> to update weights after each
                                  document in a pass (default is to update
                                  weights only after all documents are seen
                                  in a pass).
				  VERY EXPERIMENTAL!!!
      <correlate>               - use the full correlative matcher.  Very
                                  slow, but capable of matching stemmed words
                                  in any language and of matching binary files
	       (:c1: ...                - file or files to consider "success"
					  files.  The CLASSIFY succeeds if
					  these files as a group match best.
                                          if not, the CLASSIFY does a FAIL.
                      |                 - optional separator.  Spaces on each 
                                          side of the " | " are required.
                       .... :cN:)       - optional files to the right of " | "
					  are considered as a group to "fail".
					  If statement fails, execution skips 
					  to end of enclosing {..} block, 
                                          which exits with a FAIL status (see
                                          ALIUS for why this is useful).
                    (:stats:)		- optional var that will be 
                                          surgically changed to contain
                                          a formatted matching summary. In
					  some versions, must pre-exist.
			[:in:]	        - restrict statistical measure to
					  the string inside :in:
                        [:in: n m]      - take a substring of :in:, starting
                                          at n and including m characters
                        [:in: /regex/]  - take a substring of :in: that
                                          matches the regex
			  /word-pat/    - regex to describe what a 
					  parseable word is.  Default is 
                                          /[[:graph:]]+/
 			  /pR_offset/   - OSBF: change the classify threshold;
			  		  with this optional parameter the
					  success/failure decision point can
					  be changed from the default 0 to what
					  you specify. If given, the pR in
					  'stats' will be printed in the form
					  pR/pR_offset. 
                          /svm-specific controls/ - a vector of seven 
                                          parameters for SVM-classifiers

clump [:text:] (clumpfile) (stat) <flags> /regex/ /params/ - does incremental
                                   parametric clustering of documents to
                                   generate document groups.  No
                                   pre-judged corpus is required.
      [:text:]             -       input text; var-restriction allowed
      (clumpfile)          -       name of file to hold the clumps (all docs
                                   go into the same clumpfile)
      (status)             -       Status output, for the result of the clump.
                                   Clumping the null input text will give
                                   a status dump of all the documents in
                                   the entire clumpfile.
      <flags>              -       special control flags; unigram, unique,
                                   and refute are supported, with the same 
                                   meanings as in LEARN and CLASSIFY.  Default
                                   clustering is by document-to-document
                                   nearest-neighbor hyperspatial distance.
				   If you add the bychunk flag, then the
                                   distance is to the cluster's centroid.
      /regex/              -       optional tokenization regex; default is 
                                   /[[:graph:]]+/
      /params/             -       control parameters: "tag=somename" label
                                   to later refer to this document. 
                                   "clump=somename" forces a name onto a 
                                   cluster.  "n_clusters=N" says how many 
                                   doc clusters you want; if N=0 then it
                                   will simply store the document and wait
                                   for more (much faster computationally).
                                   If N < 0 the number of clusters is 
                                   determined automatically.


debug                      -       drop immediately into the interactive
                                   debugger.


eval (:result:) /instring/ -       repeatedly evaluates /instring/ until it
                                   ceases to change, then
                                   surgically places that result as
                                   the value of :result: .  EVAL uses
                                   smart (but foolable) heuristics to
                                   avoid infinite loops, like
                                   evaluating a string that evaluates
                                   to a request to evaluate itself
                                   again.  The error rate is about 1 /
                                   2^62 and (in the default configuration) 
                                   will detect looping chain groups
                                   of length 4096 or less.

                                   If the instring uses math
                                   evaluation (see section below on
                                   math operations) and the evaluation
                                   has an inequality test, (>, >=, <,
                                   <=, =, or !=) then if the test
                                   fails, the EVAL will FAIL to the
                                   end of block.  Math is IEEE-compliant,
                                   so unreasonable things like divide-by-zero
                                   may yield NaN (Not A Number) or +/- INF
 

exit  /:exitcode:/		 - ends program execution.  If supplied, the
				   return value is converted to an integer 
				   and returned as the exit code of the 
				   crm114 program.  
      /:exitcode:/               - variable to be converted to an integer
                                   and returned.  If no exit code is supplied,
				   the exit code value is 0.


fail				 - skips down to end of the current { } block
                                   and causes that block to exit with a FAIL
                                   status (see ALIUS for why this is useful)


fault /faultstr/                 - forces a FAULT with the given string as
                                   the reason.  
      /faultstr/                    - the val-expanded fault reason string 


goto /:label:/                   - unconditional branch (you can use 
				   a variable as the goal, e.g. /:*:there:/ )


hash (:result:) /input/          - compute a fast 32-bit hash of the 
                                   /input/, and ALTER :result: to the 
                                   hexadecimal hash value.  HASH is
                                   _not_ warranted to be constant across
                                   major releases of CRM114, nor is it
				   cryptographically secure.
     (:result:)                     - value that gets result.
               /input/              - string to be hashed (can contain 
                                      expanded :vars: , defaults to 
				      the data window :_dw: )


intersect (:out:) [:var1: :var2: ...] - makes :out: contain the part
                                   of the data window that is the
                                   intersection of :var1 :var2: ...
                                   ISOLATEd vars are ignored.  This
                                   only resets the value of the
                                   captured :out: variable, and does
                                   NOT alter any text in the data
                                   window.
				      				     

isolate (:var:) <flags> /initial-value/  - puts :var: into a data area 
                                   outside of the default data window
				   buffer; subsequent changes to this 
				   var don't change the data buffer (though 
                                   they may change the value of any var
				   subsequently set inside of this var).  
				   If the var already was ISOLATED, this is 
				   will stay isolated but it will surgically
                                   alter the value if a /value/ is given.
       <default>                    - only create and set var if it didn't
                                      exist before (ideal for setting defaults)
           (:var:)                  - name of ISOLATEd var (var-expanded)
                /initial-value/     - optional initial value for :var:
				      (var-expanded).  If no value is
				      supplied, the previous value is
				      retained/copied.

input <flags> (:result:) [:filename:] - read in the content of filename 
                                        if no filename, then read stdin
      <byline>                       - read one line only
         (:result:)                  - var that gets the input value
                                      (surgical overwrite).
            [:filename:]             - the file to read.  The first 
                                      blank-delimited word is taken and
                                      var-expanded; the result is the filename,
                                      even if it includes embedded spaces.  
				      Default is to read stdin.
            [:filename: offset len]  - optionally, move to offset in the
                                      file, and read len bytes.
                                      Offset and len are individually
                                      blank-delimited, and
                                      var-expanded with mathematics
                                      enabled.  If len is unspecified,
                                      the read extends to EOF or buffer 
				      limit.


learn <flags> (:class:) [:in:] /word-pat/ - learn the statistics of the :in: 
			       var (or the input window if no var)
                               as an example of class :class:
      <refute>               - flag this is as an anti-example of this
			       class- unlearn it!
      <nocase>               - ignore case in word-pat, does not
                               ignore case in actual text (use tr()
                               or the TRANSLATE command 
                               to do that on :in: if you want it)   
      <microgroom>           - enable the microgroomer to purge
                               less-important information automatically
                               whenever the statistics file gets to
                               crowded.  However, this disables other
			       optimizations that can speed up 
      <osb>		     - use orthogonal sparse bigram (OSB)
                               features and Markovian classification
                               instead of Markovian SBPH features.
			       OSB uses a subset of SBPH featuers 
			       with about 1/4 the memory and disk needs,
			       and about 4x the speed of full Markovian,
      <osbf>                 - use the Fidelis Confidence Factor 
                               local probability generator.  This
                               format is not compatible with the default,
                               but with singlesided threshold training
                               ( typically pR of 10-30 ) achieves the best 
                               accuracy yet.
      <winnow>               - use the Winnow nonstatistical classifier
                               and the OSB frontend feature generator.
                               Winnow uses .cow files, which are not 
                               compatible with the .css files for 
                               the Markovian (default) and OSB classifers.
                               Remember that for Winnow to be at it's best
                               in accuracy, it has to be trained both with
                               positive cases that failed to make a minimum
                               threshold (typically with a per-file (not 
                               overall) match quality that was below
                               a pR of .2 or more) as well as <refute> for
                               "negative reinforcement" training for any 
                               "not in class" per-file match qualities that
			       weren't at a pR of -.2 or less.)
      <hyperspace>           - use hyperspace matching; each learned 
                               document represents a light source in a
                               4-billion-dimensional hyperspace, and the 
                               set of sources that shines most brightly onto
                               the unknown document's hyperspatial location
                               is the matching class.  EXPERIMENTAL!!!
      <unigram>		     - use single-word features only; using this
                               this makes CRM114 almost exactly 
                               equivalent to most other Bayesian 
                               classifiers.  Also works with the Winnow and
                               hyperspace classifiers.
      <entropy>              - use the bit-entropy classifier.  This uses
                               compressibility of the unknown given the
                               prior learned text as a perfect compressor
                               model.  No tokenization happens- this
                               classifier works one bit at a time.  The
                               tokenizer regex is ignored; the second //
                               argument can hold an optional "fuzz factor"
                               for how close an approximation is allowed.
      <correlate>            - use the full correlative matcher.  Very
                               slow, but capable of matching stemmed words
                               in any language and of matching binary files.
                               Correlative matching does not tokenize, and
                               so you don't need to supply it with a word-pat.
              (:class:)              - name of file holding hashed results;
                                       nominal file extension is .css
                    [:in:]           - captured var containing the text
                                       to be learned (if omitted, the full
                                       contents of the data window is used)
                    [:in: n m]       - take a substring of :in:, starting
                                       at n and including m characters
                    [:in: /regex/]   - take a substring of :in: that
                                       matches the regex
    /word-pat/                       - regex that defines a "word".  Things
				       that aren't "words" are ignored.  
                                       Default is /[[:graph:]]+/.  Ignored
                                       in correllation and bit-entropy.
    /entropy_fuzz/                     Bit-entropy: this number is the 
                                       "fuzz" factor in determining when to
                                       loop back the compression algorithm
                                       Markov chain versus allocating new
                                       nodes.  You must specify an empty
                                       word-pat to use entropy fuzz.
    /svm-specific controls/          - a vector of seven parameters
                                          for SVM-classifiers


liaf				 - skips UP to START of the current {} block
					 (LIAF is FAIL spelled backwards)


match <flags> (:var1: ...) [:in:] /regex/  - Attempt to match the given regex;
                                   if match succeds, variables are bound;
                                   if match fails, program skips to the
                                   closing '}' of this block
      <absent>                     - statement succeeds if match not present
      <nocase>                     - ignore case when matching
      <literal>	                   - No special characters in regex (only
                                     supported with TREregex, not GNUregex.)
                                     Think of this as WYSIWYG matching.
      <fromstart>                  - start match at start of the [:in:] var
      <fromcurrent>		   - start match at start of previous 
				     successful match on the [:in:] var
      <fromnext>                   - start match at one character past
                                     the start of the previous successful
                                     match on the [:in:] var
      <fromend>                    - start match at one character past
                                     the end of prev. match on this [:in:] var
      <newend>                     - require match to end after end of
                                     prev. match on this [:in:] var
      <backwards>                  - search backward in the [:in:] variable
				     from the last successful match.
      <nomultiline>                - execute the search in blocks of one
				     line of text each, so the result will
				     never span a line.  This means that
				     ^ and $ will match at the beginning
				     and end of each line, rather than 
				     the beginning and end of the full text.
              (:var1: ...)         - optional result vars.  The first
                                     var gets the text matched by the
                                     full regex.  The second, third, etc.
                                     vars get each subsequent parenthesized
                                     subexpression, in left-to-right order
                                     of the subexpression's left parenthesis.
                                     These are "captures", not ALTERs, so
                                     text overlapping prior :var: values is
                                     left unchanged.
              [:in:]               - search only in the variable specified;
                                     if omitted, :_dw: (the full input data
                                     window) is used
              [:in: :start: :len:] - search in the :in: input var, limiting
                                     the area searched to :start: to :len:
				     (zero-origin counted)
              [:in: /inregex/ ]    - search in the :in: input var, limiting
                                     the searched area to whatever matches
                                     the inregex (this doesn't use or affect
				     previous successful match values)
                         /regex/   - POSIX regex (with \ escapes as needed)
    
          NB: If you build CRM114 to use the GNU regex library for MATCHing,
	      be warned that GNU REGEX has numerous issues.  See the 
	      KNOWN_BUGS file for a detailed listing.


output <flags> [filename] /output-text/ - output an arbitrary string 
			            with captured values expanded.
       <append>			  - append to the file (otherwise, the 
				    previous contents of the file is lost).
	    [:filename:]          - the file to write.  The first
                                    blank-delimited word is taken and
                                    var-expanded; the result is the
                                    filename, even if it includes
                                    embedded spaces.  Default output
                                    is to stdout.  stderr is recognized.
            [:filename: offset len] - optionally, move to offset in
                                    the file, and maximum write len
                                    bytes.  Offset and len are
                                    individually blank-delimited, and
                                    var-expanded with mathematics
                                    enabled.  If len is unspecified,
                                    the write is the length of the
				    expansion of /output-text/
              /output-text/       - string to output (var-expanded)

pmulc (clumpfile) [:text:] <flags> /regex/  - use the clumpfile as a lookup 
                                    to translate documents to their 
                                    appropriate clusters.  The text does
                                    not get added into the clumpfile.
      [:text:]              -       input text; var-restriction allowed.  
      (clumpfile)           -       name of file to holding the clumps
      /regex/               -       optional tokenization regex; default is
                                    /[[:graph:]]+/
      <flags>               -       The optional flags are bychunk, unique,
                                    and unigram, with the same functions
                                    as under clump.




return /returnval/                - return from a CALL.  Note that since
                                    CALL executes in shared space with the
                                    caller, all changes made in the CALLed
                                    routine are shared with the caller.
      /returnval/                  - this (var-expanded) value is returned
                                     to the caller (or if the caller doesn't
                                     accept return values, it's discarded).

syscall <flags> (:in:) (:out:) (:status:) /command_or_label/ 
                                    - execute a shell command or fork 
                                      to the specified label.  This happens
                                      in a fresh copy of the environment; 
                                      there is no communication with the main 
                                      program except via the :in:, :out:, 
                                      and :status: vars.
                                      Output over the buffer length is 
				      discarded unless you <keep> the process
                                      around for multiple readings.
        <keep>                      - don't send an EOF after feeding the
				      full input (this will usually keep the
				      syscalled process around).  Later
                                      syscalls with the same :status:
                                      var will continue feeding to and 
                                      reading from the kept proc.
        <async>                     - don't wait for process to output an
                                      EOF; just grab what's available in 
                                      the process's output pipe and proceed
				      (default limit per syscall is 256 Kb).
                                      The process then runs to completion 
                                      independently and asynchronously.
                                      (This is "fire and forget" mode, and
                                      is mutually exclusive with <keep>. )
               (:in:)               - var-expanded string to feed to command
                                      as input (can be null if you don't want
                                      to send the process something.)  You
				      _MUST_ specify this if you want to 
				      specify an :out: variable.
                (:out:)             - var-expanded varname to place results
                                      into (MUST pre-exist, can be null if
                                      you don't want to read the process's
                                      output (yet, or at all).  Limit per
				      syscall is 256 Kbytes.  You _MUST_
                                      specify this if you want to use the
                                      :status: variable).  This is 
                                      a surgical alter.
                  (:status:)        - if you want to keep a minion proc
                                      around, or catch the exit status
				      of the process, specify a varname here.  
				      The minion process's PID and pipes 
                                      will be stored here.  The program
				      can access the proc again with 
                                      another syscall by using this var again.
                                      When the process exits, it's exit code
                                      will be surgically stored here (unless
                                      you specified <async>)
                /command_or_label/  - the command or entrypoint you want to
                                      run.  This arg is var-expanded; if the
                                      first word is a :label:, the fork begins
                                      execution at the label.  If the first
                                      word is not a :label:, then the entire
                                      string is handed off to the shell to
                                      be executed as a shell command.


translate <flags> (:dest:) [:src] /from_charset/ /to_charset/   - do a 
				  tr()-like translation of 8-bit characters in
				  the from_charset to the corresponding 
                                  characters in the to_charset.
  <unique>                       - repeated sequential copies of the same 
                                   char in from_charset are replaced by a
                                   single copy, then translated.   
  <literal>                      - from_charset and to_charset are literal,
                                   no var-expansion, ranging, or inversion
                                   performed.
  [:src:]                        - source of data.  Can be var-restricted.
                                   Default is the default data window :_dw:
  (:dest:)                       - destination to put result.  defaults to
                                   the default data window :_dw:
  /from_charset/                 - var-expanded charset of characters to 
                                   be translated from.  Use hyphens for ranges
                                   like a-e meaning abcde .  Reversed ranges
                                   such as e-a meaning edcba work.  (this is
                                   different than tr() !)  Set inversion
                                   as in ^a-z mean all characters that 
                                   aren't lower case characters works.
                                   Character duplication is not an error.
				   To use - as a literal character, make it 
                                   the first or last character.  To use ^ 
                                   as a literal character, make it any but
                                   the first character.  ASCII \-escapes
                                   like \n and \xFF work.
  /to_charset/                   - charset of characters to be translated
                                   to.  Same rules as from_charset; excess 
                                   characters are ignored; if not enough 
                                   characters are available, start over using
                                   the to_charset characters from the 
                                   beginning (this is different than tr().)
				   If to_charset is not given, then all
				   chars in from_charset are deleted.


trap (:reason:) /trap_regex/     - traps faults from both FAULT statements
                                   and program errors occurring anywhere in
				   the preceding bracket-block.  If no fault
				   exists, TRAP does a SKIP to end of block.
				   If there is a fault and the fault reason
                                   string matches the trap_regex, the fault 
				   is trapped, and execution continues with
				   the line after the TRAP, otherwise the 
                                   fault is passed up to the next surrounding 
                                   trapped bracket block.
     (:reason:)                     - the fault message that caused this
                                      FAULT.  If it was a user fault, this
                                      is the text the user supplied in the
                                      FAULT statement.  This variable is
                                      allocated as an ISOLATED variable.
          /trap_regex/              - the regex that determines what kind of
				      faults this TRAP will accept.  Putting
				      a wildcard here (e.g. /.*/ means that
				      ALL trappable faults will be trapped.


union (:out:) [:var1: :var2: ...] - makes :out: contain the union of the data
                                   window segments that contains var1, var2... 
                                   plus any intervening text as well.  Any 
                                   ISOLATEd var is ignored.  This is 
                                   non-surgical, and does not alter the 
                                   data window


window <flags> (:w-var:) (:s-var:) /cut-regex/ /add-regex/ - window slider.
				   This deletes to and including the
				   cut-regex from :var: (default: use the 
                                   data window), then reads adds from std. 
                                   input till we find add-regex (inclusive).  
       <nocase>                    - ignore case when matching cut- and add-

       <bychar>                    - (default) read one char at a time and

                                     match pattern, so if the pattern can match
                                     a zero-length string ( say, /.*/ ), this
                                     can yield zero characters added.  Use
                                     a pattern like /.+/ to prevent this.

     ------------ A Quick Regex Intro ---------

A regex is a pattern match.  Do a "man 7 regex" for details.

Matches are, by default "first starting point that matches, then 
longest match possible that can fit".  

  a through z
  A through Z   - all match themselves
  0 thorugh 9
  
  most punctuation - matches itself, but check below!

  .       - the 'period' char, matches any character	

  *       - repeat preceding 0 or more times
  
  +       - repeat preceding 1 or more times
 
  ?       - repeat preceding 0 or 1 time 

  [abcde]    any one of the letters a, b, c, d, or e
	      
  [a-q]      the letters a through q (just one of them)

  [a-eh-mqzt]   the letters a through e, plus h through m, plus q, z, and t

  [^xyz]     any one letter EXCEPT one of x, y, or z

  [^a-e]     any one letter EXCEPT one of a through e

  {n}        repetition count: match the preceding exactly n times

  {n,}       repetition count: match the preceding at least n times

  {n,m}      repetition count: match the preceding at least n and no more
	     than m times (sadly, POSIX restricts this to a maximum of 255
	     repeats.  Nested repeats like (.{255}){10} will work, but are
	     very very slow).


  [[:<:]]    matches at the start of a word (GNU regex only)
  \<         matches at the start of a word (TRE regex only)
 
  [[:>:]]    matches the end of a word (GNU regex only)
  \>         matches at the end of a word (TRE regex only)

  ^          As the first character in a match, it matches only at the 
             start of a block; this usually means start of the 
             input variable.  If you use <nomultiline> then each line is
             it's own block and so ^ means "start of line".

  ^          As the last character in a match, it matches only at the 
             end of a block; this usually means the end of the 
             input variable.  If you use <nomultiline> then each line is
             it's own block and so $ means "end of line".

  .         (a period) matches any _single_ character (except start-of-line or
            end of line "virtual characters", but it does match a newline).

  (match)    - the () go away, and the string that matched inside is
	     available for capturing.  Use \( and \) to match actual 
	     parenthesis. 

  a|b        match a _or_ b, such as foo|bar which will match "foo" or 
             "bar" (multiple characters!).  To get a shorter extent of 
             ORing, use parenthesis, e.g. /f(oo|ba)r/ matches "foor" 
             or "fbar", but not foo or bar.

The following are other POSIX expressions, which mostly do what you'd
guess they'd do from their names.

  [[:alnum:]]   <-- a-z, A-Z and 0-9
  [[:alpha:]]   <-- a-z and A-Z
  [[:blank:]]   <-- space and tab only 
  [[:space:]]   <-- "whitespace" (space, tab, vertical tab (^K), \n, \r, ..)
  [[:cntrl:]]   <-- control characters
  [[:digit:]]   <-- 0-9
  [[:lower:]]   <-- lower-case letters a-z 
  [[:upper:]]   <-- upper-case letters A-Z
  [[:graph:]]   <-- any character that puts ink on paper or lights a pixel
  [[:print:]]   <-- any character that moves the "print head" or cursor.
  [[:punct:]]   <-- punctuation characters
  [[:xdigit:]]  <-- hex digits 0-9, a-f and A-F


----- The following are only available with the TRE-based versions -----


  *?, +?, ??, {n,m}?  - repeat the preceding expression 0-or-more,
   	      1-or-more, 0-or-1, or n-to-m times, but _shortest_ match
   	      that fits, given the already-selected start point of the
   	      regex. This is an "anti-greedy" match, unlike the normal
              match that wants to have the longest possible resultiing match

  \N        - where N is 1 through 9 - matches the N'th parenthesized
	      previous subexpression.  You don't have to backslash-escape 
	      the backslash (e.g. write this as \1 or as \\1, either will
	      work)

  \Q        - start verbatim quoting - all following characters represent 
              exactly themselves; no repcounts or wildcards apply.  This is 
              _only_ terminated by a \E or the end of the regex.

  \E        - end of verbatim quoting. 

  \<	    - start of a word (doesn't use up a character)
  
  \>	    - end of a word (doesn't use up a character)

  \d	    - a digit

  \D	    - not a digit

  \s	    - a space

  \S	    - not a space

  \w	    - a word char ( a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or _ )

  \W	    - not a word char


  (?:some-regex) - parenthesize a subexpression, but _don't_ capture a 
              submatch for it.

  (?inr-inr:regex) - Let you turn on or off case independence, nomultiline,
              and right-associative (rather than the default left-associative)
	      matching.  These nest as well.

              i - case independent matching.  examples:

	           /(?i:abc)/              matches 'abc', 'AbC', 'ABC', etc...

                   /(?i:ABC(?-i:de)FGH)/   matches ABCdeFGH, abcdefgh,
                                          but not ABCdEFGH or ABCDEFGH

              n - don't match newlines with wildcards such as .* or with
                  anti-wildcards like [^j-z].  "-n" _allows_ matching of 
                  newlines (this is slightly counterintuitive).  eg:

                  /(?n:a.*z)/            matches 'abcxyz' but not
                                          'abc
                                           xyz'

                  /(?-n:a.*z)/           matches both (this does NOT override
                                         the <nomultiline> flag; <nomultiline>
                                         essentially "blocks" the searched text
                                         at newlines, and searches within
                                         those blocks only)

              r - right-associate matching.  This changes only sub-matches,
                  never whether the match itself succeeds or fails.  (I 
		  haven't come up with a good example for this; any
		  suggestions?)




    --------------  Notes on Sequence of Evaluation -------------

By default, CRM114 supports string length and mathematical evaluation
only in an EVAL statement, although it can be set to allow these in
any place where a var-expanded variable is allowed (see the -q flag).
The default value ( zero ) allows stringlength and math evaluation
only in EVAL statements, and uses non-precedence (that is, strict
left-to-right unless parenthesis are used) algebraic notation.  -q 1
uses RPN instead of algebraic, again allowing stringlength and math
evaluation only in EVAL expressions.  Modes 2 and 3 allow stringlength
and math evaluation in _any_ var-expanded expression, with
non-precedence algebraic notation and RPN notation respectively.

You can overide whether to use Algebraic or RPN precedence of any 
math evaluation by using an A or an R as the first character of the
math evaluation string.

Evaluation is always left-to-right; there is no precedence of
operators beyond the sequential passes noted below.

The evaluation is done in four sequential passes:

 1)   \-constants like \n, \o377 and \x3F are substituted in.  You must
      use three digits for octal and two digits for hex.  To write something
      that will literally appear as one of these constants, escape the 
      backslasn with another backslash, i.e. to output '\o075' use '\\o075'.

 2)   :*:var: variables are substituted (note the difference between
      a constant like '\n' and a variable like ":*:_nl:" here - constants
      are substituted first, then variables are substituted.).  If there
      is no such variable, then the 'variable name' is it's own result, so
      :*:I_am_not_defined: yields "I_am_not_defined".

 3)   :+:var: indirection variables are substituted.  This is equivalent
      to taking :*: twice immediately ( note that :*::*:foo: does not
      do this!)  Note that if a regular variable is indirected, the
      result is unchanged (just as if a non-variable is :*:
      substituted; the result is the input)

 4)   :#:var: string-length operations are performed.  (you don't have to
      expand a :var: first, you can take the string length directly, as
      in :#:_dw: to get the length of the default data window.  Thus, you 
      can take the length of a string that contains a :, which would normally
      "end" the :#: operator ).

 5)   :@:expression: mathematical expressions are performed; syntax is
      either RPN or non-precedenced (parens required) algebraic
      notation.  Embedded non-evaluated strings in a mathematical
      expression is currently a no-no.  If the first character of
      the math string is an A or an R, it forces Algebraic or RPN
      evaluation; otherwise the -q value determines which evaluator
      to use.
    
      Allowed operators are:  

             + - * / % ^ v > < = >= <= != e E f F g G x X only.

      The '^' operator is exponentiation; A ^ B is A raised to the B power.
      The 'v' operator is any-base log; A v B is the log of B in logbase 
      A ; note that the logbase is _required_ and there is no default.
      

      Only >, >=, <, <=, = and != set logical results; they also evaluate
      to 1 and 0 for continued chain operations - e.g. 

	((:*:a: > 3) + (:*:b: > 5) + (:*:c: > 9) > 2)

      is true IFF any of the following is true

	 a > 3 and b > 5
	 a > 3 and c > 9
	 b > 5 and c > 9

      Formatting operators: e E f F g G x X - the left side value is
      unchanged, but the right side value is used as a formatting
      precision value (note that x and X do not change precision),
      (i.e. the speed of light expressed in E 7.2 precision such as by
      299792458 E 7.2 is 3.00E+08) The operators e, E, f, F, g, G, x,
      and X operators have the same meaning as in C.  (beware a
      precision after the decimal of 10 though; and note that an x or X
      format is limited to 32 bits.)


    -------------- Notes on Approximate REGEX matching ---------

The TRE regex engine (which is the default engine) supports
approximate matching.  The GNU engine does not support approximate
matching.

Approximate matching is specified similarly to a "repetition count" in
a regular regex, using brackets.  This approximation applies to the
previous parenthesized expression (again, just like repetion counts).
You can specify maximum total changes, and how many inserts, deletes,
and substitutions you wish to allow.  The minimum-error match is found
and reported, if it exists within the bounds you state.

The basic syntax is:
  
  (text-to-match){~[maxerrs] [#maxsubsts] [+maxinserts] [-maxdeletes]}

Note that the '~' (with an optional maxerr count) is _required_ (that's how
we know it's an approximate regex rather than just a rep-count); if you
don't specify a max error count, you will get the best match, if you do,
the match will have at most that many errors.

Remember that you specify the changes to the text in the _pattern_
necessary to make it match the text in the string being searched.

You cannot use approximate regexes and backrefs (like \1) in the same 
regex.  This is a limitation of in TRE at this point.

You can also use an inequality in addition to the basic syntax above:

  (text-to-match){~[maxerrs] [basic-syntax] [nI + mD + oS < K] }

where n, m, and o are the costs per insertion, deletion, and substitution
respectively, 'I', 'D', and 'S' are indicators to tell which cost goes
with which kind of error, and K is the total cost of the errors; the cost
of the errors is always strictly less than K.

Here are some examples.

  (foobar)       - exactly matches "foobar"

  (foobar){~}    - finds the closest match to "foobar", with the minimum number
		   of inserts, deletes, and substitutions.  This match always
		   succeeds, as six substitutions or additions is always
		   enough to turn any string into one that contains 'foobar'.

  (foobar){~3}   - finds the closest match to "foobar", with no more than 3
	           inserts, deletes, or substitutions

  (foobar){~2 +2 -1 #1) - find the closest match to "foobar", with at most
		   two errors total, and at most two inserts, one delete,
		   and one substitution.

  (foobar){~4 #1 1i + 2d < 5 } - find the closest match to "foobar",
		   with at most four errors total, at most one substitution,
		   and with the number of insertions plus 2x the number of
		   deletions less than 5.
  
  (foo){~1}(bar){~1) - find the closest match to "foobar", with at most one
		   error in the "foo" and one error in the "bar".


     ------------ Notes on Classifier Choices -------

CRM114 allows the user a whole gamut of different classification
algorithms, and various tunings on classifications.

The default classifier is a Markovian classifier that attempts to model 
the language as a Markov Random Field with site size of 5 (in plainspeak,
it looks at each word in the context of a window 5 words long; words 
within that window are considered "directly related" and are used to
generate local probabilities.  Words outside that 5-word window are 
not considered in relation to each word, but get considered when the window
slides over to them).  

The Markovian classifier is quite fast; more than fast enough for a 
single user or even a small office.  Filtering speed varies- with no
optimization and overflow safegaurding (that is, with <microgroom> 
enabled) filtering speed is usually in excess of what a fractional
T1 line can downlink.

The Markovian filter can be sped up considerably by turning off
overflow safegaurding by not using <microgroom>; this optimization
speeds up learning significantly, but it means that learning is
unsafe.  System operators must instead manually monitor the fullness
of the .css files and either manually groom them or expand them as
required (or a script must be used to atomate this maintenance, which
can be done "in flight").

[ This classifier is the original CRM114 classifier and should be
considered deprecated for new work, although it is still supported.
The recommended classifier right now for production work is OSB or
OSBF. ]

The next generation filter (and one of the two recommended for 
new production work] is the OSB filter, based on orthogonal sparse
bigrams.  OSB is natively about 4x faster than full Markovian, but
loses some of this advantage if overflow safegaurding (no
<microgroom>) is used.  OSB is almost as accurate as Markovian if disk
space is unlimited, and more accurate than Markovian if disk space is
limited.  OSB is the recommended default for new users because
it works very well across a broad range of inputs.  OSB uses .css
files as well, but (because of a coding error that was released 
into the wild and unnoticed until most people were already using
it in the incompatible form) OSB is, by default, incompatible with 
Markov .css files; there is a compile-time switch to make it compatible
if you want.

Another related classifier is the OSBF (OSB with Fidelis mods such as
the ECCF dynamic weighting) filter.  The good news is that OSBF can
sometimes be even more accurate than OSB or Winnow, by using an
exponential weighting to determine local probabilities, giving a
filter is that it works very, Very, VERY well.  It's incompatible with
any of the other filters (uses .cfc files).  It's also a good choice
for new production work.

Another filter with excellent statistics is the Winnow filter.  Winnow
is a non-statistical method that uses the OSB front end feature
generator.  Winnow is different than the statistical filters, in that
it absolutely requires both positive training and negative training to
work, but then it works _very_ well.  

With Winnow, you don't just train errors into the correct class (i.e.
in emulation of an SVM).  Instead, you set a "thick threshold"
(usually about +/- 0.2 in the pR scale), and any positive class that
doesn't get a per-correct-file score of at least 0.2 pR gets trained
as a positive example.  Symmetrically, any negative class and negative
example that doesn't get below -0.2 of pR needs to be trained as a
negative example (that is, using the flags <winnow refute>.)

This means that with Winnow, on an error you train one or both files.
Even if the classifier gives the correct overall result, if the
per-file pR values are inside the -0.2 <= per_file_pR <= 0.2
thick-threshold, you may have to train one or both files as well.
(these per-file pR values are in the statistics output variable).

The slowest classifier is the correlative filter.  This filter is based on
a full NxM correlation of the unknown text against each of the known text
corpora.  It's very slow (perhaps 100x slower than Markovian) but is 
capable of classifying texts containing stemmed words, of texts composed of
binary files, and texts that cannot be reasonably "tokenized".  
The <correlate> filter should be considered perpetually an experimental
feature, and it is not as well characterized as the Markovian or OSB filters.
The correlative filter is not recommended for general production work.

A semi-experimental filter is the Hyperspace filter; this uses a 
variation on the K-Nearest-Neighbor method.  It's usually not quite
as accurate as OSB, but it can filter againts very high levels of
intentional obfuscation.  Hyperspace uses a different (and self-growing)
file format.  Hyperspace usually trains best with a small thick-threshold
training, similar to Winnow; as of 20061101 the factors have been 
renormalized so that Hyperspace values within +/- 10 pR units give a 
good thick-threshold for training.  

The bit-entropy filter is a different *kind* of filter; instead of
using tokens, it constructs an optimal compression system out
of the known texts, then it tries to compress the unknown text 
as much as possible, using the known texts as prior probabilities.
Better compression implies closer match.  The amazing thing about this
is that it works at all- and it actually works very well.  Because
there's no tokenizer, the entropy filter can work against languages 
that don't use spaces to delimit words, such as some Asian languages.
It works quite well against spam.  This filter is still experimental
and noncompatible upgrades may occur - keep your training data if you
use this filter!

				     
     ------------ Overall Language Notes ------------

Here's how to remember what goes where in the CRM114 language.

Unlike most computer languages, CRM114 uses inflection (or declension)
rather than position to describe what role each part of a statement
plays.  The declensions are marked by the delimiters- the /, ( and ), <
and >, and [ and ].

By and large, you can mix up the arguments to each kind of statement
without changing their meaning.  Only the ACTION needs to be first.
Other parts of the statement can occur in any order, save that
multiple (paren_args) and /pattern_args/ must stay in their nominal
order but can go anywhere in the statement.  They do not need to be
consecutive.

The parts of a CRM114 statement are:

	  ACTION	     - the verb.  This is at the start of the 
                               statment.

          /pattern/	     - the overall pattern the verb should 
                               use, analogous to the "subject" of the 
                               statement.

	  <flags>	     - modifies how the ACTION does the work. 
			       You'd call these "adverbs" in human 
                               languages.

	  (vars)	     - what variables to use as adjuncts in 
                               the action (what would be called the 
                               "direct objects").  These can get changed
			       when the action happens.

	  [limited-to]       - where the action is allowed to take place
			       (think of it as the "indirect object").
			       Generally these are not directly changed
			       by the action.  These may contain "adjectival
			       phrases - var restrictions, either by subscript
			       or by regex or both.
