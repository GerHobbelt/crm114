"What is Lorem Ipsum?\n"
"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. 	Why do we use it?\n"
"It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n"
"Where does it come from?\n"
"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n"
"\n"
"The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. 	Where can I get some?\n"
"There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\n"

"\"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"\n"

"\"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"\n"

"\n"
"HOW TO CITE THIS PAGE: This web utility may be cited in APA style in the following manner:\n"
"\n"
"Preacher, K. J. (2001, April). Calculation for the chi-square test: An interactive calculation tool for chi-square tests of goodness of fit and independence [Computer software]. Available from http://www.quantpsy.org.\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this page\n"
"This web page is intended to provide a brief introduction to chi-square tests of independence and goodness-of-fit. These tests are used to detect group differences using frequency (count) data. This page also provides an interactive tool allowing researchers to conduct chi-square tests for their own research. Any introductory applied statistics text should have a good description of these chi-square tests, but following is a condensed introduction.\n"
"\n"
"About the chi-square test of independence\n"
"Often a researcher wishes to see if the frequency of cases possessing some quality varies among levels of a given factor or among combinations of levels of two or more factors. In such situations, the appropriate test is the chi-square test of goodness of fit or the chi-square test of independence for k groups.\n"
"\n"
"How it's done\n"
"To conduct the chi-square test, the researcher enters observed frequencies corresponding to combinations of levels of relevant factors (here, called \"condition\" and \"group,\" but these are labels of convenience). Sums of elements within rows and within columns are then computed (call these marginal Ns). The chi-square test of independence is used to test the null hypothesis that the frequency within cells is what would be expected, given these marginal Ns. The chi-square test of goodness of fit is used to test the hypothesis that the total sample N is distributed evenly among all levels of the relevant factor.\n"
"The expected value within each cell, if the null condition is true (i.e., if the factors have no significant influence on observed frequencies in the population), is simply the product of the row total and column total divided by the overall sample N for the test of independence and N divided by the number of levels of the single factor for the test of goodness of fit. If Oij is the observed frequency and Eij the expected frequency for the cell corresponding to the ith condition and the jth group, then chi-square is:\n"
"\n"
"If there is only one factor of interest with (k > 1) levels, the same formula will work, with i or j being set to 1. The test presented here can be used to test only 1- or 2-dimensional arrays. Arrays of higher dimension are possible, and are based on the same principle and even use the same formula, although they involve multiple nested summations.\n"
"\n"
"How to use this page\n"
"Input observed frequencies into the white cells. I realize that not very many designs involve exactly 10 conditions and 10 groups - if your design is smaller, then choose some subset of rows and columns in which to enter your data. For example, if your design is (2 x 3), then you may choose to enter your data in the 6 cells in the upper left portion of the data table, defined by the first two Conditions and the first three Groups. You can choose any subset of rows and columns for your data. You can also opt to leave cells corresponding to observed frequencies of zero blank. Non-integer observed frequencies are allowed, although it is difficult to imagine how one would obtain these in actual research.\n"
"\n"
"If you are performing a test of goodness of fit, you may choose to enter your data in any single column or row. However, observed zero frequencies need to be explicitly included (i.e., you'll need to actually type \"0\" in those cells, otherwise it is assumed that those cells are not part of your design). Once you have entered your data, click on the Calculate button and expect to see output in the beige cells (they should be white if you are using older versions of Netscape). Do not panic if you see scientific notation for your p-value - that simply means that p is really small.\n"
"\n"
"This tool also yields a chi-square incorporating Yates' correction for continuity. This correction is often employed to improve the accuracy of the null-condition sampling distribution of chi-square.\n"
"\n"
"Warning\n"
"Use of the chi-square tests is inappropriate if any expected frequency is below 1 or if the expected frequency is less than 5 in more than 20% of your cells. The status cell at the bottom of the table will let you know if there is a problem. In the 2 x 2 case of the chi-square test of independence, expected frequencies less than 5 are usually considered acceptable if Yates' correction is employed.\n"

"When using the chi-square goodness of fit test, sometimes it is useful to be able to specify your own expected frequencies.

Use as many cells in this table as necessary, making sure that (1) the marginal total is the same for both observed and expected frequencies, (2) there are no expected frequencies less than 1, and (3) no more than 20% of your expected frequencies are less than 5. If a frequency is entered in an Observed cell, then a frequency must also be entered in the corresponding Expected cell (and vice versa).\n"

" Blurb Wags the Long Tail\n"
"Stacey Higginbotham, Thursday, March 13, 2008 at 5:00 AM PT Comments (1)\n"
"\n"
"In a few weeks, online bookmaking site Blurb will launch a new community called BlurbNation, a section of the Blurb site where people can connect with a professional designer that will take their photos, stories, recipes or any other images and pull them together into a book. Such a move is aimed at expanding Blurb’s business beyond the 90,000 books it printed in 2007 — and to take it out of the red.\n"
"\n"
"Blurb, which was founded in 2004, launched its site in April of 2006 and is on track to turn in breakeven results this year, is both a digital bookmaker and an example of yesteryear’s big Internet trend: The Long Tail (It seems so long ago, but it was only three-and-half years ago that Anderson wrote about the idea in Wired). Since we move at digital speed, we’ve already discarded that trend (and possibly refuted it) for social everything. But true business growth doesn’t take place at that harried clip, it typically requires the five to seven years allotted by VCs for their investment time frames.\n"
"\n"
"00 Those time frames are there for a reason. Blurb CEO Eileen Gittins Blurb says the company exceeded its revenue expectations by 40 percent last year. (In 2007 she told Time she anticipated sales between $5 million and $10 million for the year.) And in the quarter following its launch late last year in Europe, sales from the continent have climbed to account for 17 percent of total overall revenues from a mere 2.5 percent.\n"
"\n"
"To me this is a nice reminder to avoid focusing solely on the trend du jour, but also to keep in mind that much of the world runs at business speed, and that it’s the people out in the rest of the world that break a technology site into the mainstream.\n"
"\n"
"Blurb makes books, nothing terribly technical about it, until you think about how impossible it would be, before the Internet existed, to source, edit, design and print 90,000 different titles in a single year. Its biggest customers are corporations trying to create memorable advertorials, though artists and average Americans also pull together their own works of art. Blurb competes with other online publishers LuLu and Xlibris, but has the lead in high-end photobooks.\n"
"\n"
"The cool thing about marrying the digital medium with one that began in 1040 with the first Chinese printing presses (sorry Gutenberg), is that when it comes to user-generated content, Blurb may end up making UGC profitable before YouTube does. Profitability isn’t everything and I’m not sure how Blurb could ever reach more people than YouTube, but it’s nice to talk to an online service that can make money in the here and now.\n"
