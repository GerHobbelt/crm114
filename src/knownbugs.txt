    CRM114 Known Bugs:

1) (fixed)

2) Matcher bug... This bug is in the GNU library, not my code.  If you
match on a window longer than 20479 characters, AND you have multiline
matching enabled, AND the pattern is of the form ".*literalvale", then
the match will FAIL even if it should have succeeded.  The TRE library
does not have this bug.  (see "make experimental")

   (FIXED - default library is now TRE 0.7.4)

3) Matcher bug - this is another bug in the GNU regex library.  If you
have a pattern of the form ^Q$ where Q is a single character, and you
don't specify <nomultiline>, then the match will mysteriously fail even
if it should have succeeded.  The TRE regex library does not have this
problem (see "make experimental").

   (FIXED - default library is now TRE 0.7.4)


3+) More on bug 3 - it seems that _many_ patterns of the form ^blah$
do not work correctly, including the simple case for a null string of
^$ even if you _do_ specify nomultiline.  The TRE regex library does
not have this problem either.

   (FIXED - default library is now TRE 0.7.4)


3++)  The GNU regex engine considers /./ to match not only the
string "a", but also the empty string "".  This is in contrast
to /../ which does match "aa" but not "a".

   (FIXED - default library is now TRE 0.7.4)


4) Thinking bug...  If you ALTER one variable that contains another
variable, the second variable moves as though you inserted/deleted
characters at the START of the first variable, and then overtyped
all of the evenly matched characters.  This can lead to
counterintuitive results; the fix is to ISOLATE any variable that
has to hold value across an ALTER operation.

   (FIXED - default library is now TRE 0.7.4)


5) FIXED AT LONG LAST (version 20040815) Memory leak - if you MATCH to
bind a var, then ISOLATE that var, then MATCH it again, the old
ISOLATEd usage is _not_ recovered.  If you do this enough, you will
run out of buffer space and get a FATAL ERROR.

The quick workaround is to use two variables- for example, :a: and
:isolated_a: as shown here:

     match :a:
     isolate (:isolated_a:) /:*:a:/
     match (:a:)
     isolate (:isolated_a:) /:*:a:/

ad infinitum, which will _not_ leak memory.

   (REAL FIX in by 20060629 - off by one error in line 920
   of crm_var_hash_table.c)

6) If you do math, and the output is bigger than a trillion or less than
1 trillionth, the output comes out in E-notation.

This is fine - except that you can't _re_use that, because the numerical
parser doesn't understand E-notation.

Be warned.  Or send me a patch!

   (FIXED - the switchover between fixed and E notation is now
   a soft set, and the reader DOES understand E-notation)



7)  If you malform a math expression (like leave off the closing colon)
the last digit of your result gets eaten.

    e.g.:

    /:@: 1 + 123 :/   --> 124  (correct)
    /:@: 1 + 123  /   --> 12   (incorrect)

Patches appreciated on this one too.

   ( SEMI-FIXED - you now get an error that says "you didn't end with
     an ':', which is often an error.  However, it still gets the wrong
     result. )



    Let me know if you find any others!

                                                               -Bill Y.
