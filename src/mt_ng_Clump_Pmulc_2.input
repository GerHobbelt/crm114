CRM114's unique strengths are the data structure (everything is
a string and a string can overlap another string), it's ability
to work on truly infinitely long input streams, it's ability to
use extremely advanced classifiers to sort text, and the ability
to do approximate regular expressions (that is, regexes that
don't quite match) via the TRE regex library.
