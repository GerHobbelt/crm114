#
# It is possible for crm114 to DoS if it receives a very large message.
# To prevent this, the author has coded an upper bound to the size
# message that mailfilter.crm will accept.
#
# We can prevent messages from hitting that limit by only feeding a
# portion of the message to crm114, but this has a slightly more
# subtle problem in that messages are often fed to crm114 as filters,
# which means procmail expects the message to be modified. Using
# head(1) to limit the message size going into a filter recipe will
# truncate the actual message, not just a copy. "Oops"
#
# This recipe set uses crm114 as a direct "f"ilter if the message is
# smaller than $BIGGEST, otherwise the message is truncated with head
# and crm114 is set (via "--stats_only" switch) to report only. The
# output from crm114 when run in this mode is captured and formail is
# used to put the same headers in place that crm114 would normally
# add.
