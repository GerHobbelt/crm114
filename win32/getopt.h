/*!
 * Get definitions and prototypes for functions to process the
 * arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the program name) for
 * options given in OPTS.
 *
 * Return the option character from OPTS just read.  Return -1 when
 * there are no more options.  For unrecognized options, or options
 * missing arguments, `optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is
 * returned.
 *
 * The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
 * letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter
 * takes an argument, to be placed in `optarg'.
 *
 * If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is
 * optional.  This behavior is specific to the GNU `getopt'.
 *
 * The argument `--' causes premature termination of argument
 * scanning, explicitly telling `getopt' that there are no more
 * options.
 *
 * If OPTS begins with `--', then non-option arguments are treated as
 * arguments to the option '\0'.  This behavior is specific to the GNU
 * `getopt'.
