 you should see this --><--and this, with nothing in between. 
 
 --- the next thing you see SHOULD be an error "unable to read-open"--- 
 Caught the error  - fault text was 
crm114: *ERROR*
For some reason, I was unable to read-open the file named 'zoob.zipulrlfjf' (full path: '/windows/G/prj/3actual/crm114/tests/zoob.zipulrlfjf') (expanded from 'zoob.zipulrlfjf'): error = 2(No such file or directory)
Sorry, but this program is very sick and probably should be killed off.
