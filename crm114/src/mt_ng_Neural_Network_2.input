CRM114 also sports a very powerful subprocess control facility, and
a unique syntax and program structure that puts the fun back in
programming (OK, you can run away screaming now).  The syntax is
declensional rather than positional; the type of quote marks around
an argument determine what that argument will be used for.

The typical CRM114 program uses regex operations more often
than addition (in fact, math was only added to TRE in the waning
days of 2003, well after CRM114 had been in daily use for over
a year and a half).
