    * Dropped support for MSVC2005
	

2009-02-22 Ger Hobbelt

    * Added the .spec file for by Jimmy Tang

    * Added the alt.osb / alt.osbf / alt.markovian / alt.winnow and 
      alt.hyperspace classifiers to the 'make check' test set.

    * Added mailfilter/mkcss.crm to ensure we have a script which produces 
      new CSS files which match the needs of mailfilter / mailreaver / 
      mailtrainer EXACTLY - as this script will load the same mailfilter.cf 
      and thus 'knows' about the precise classifier settings you are using 
      within your mail filter setup.

    * Fixed the VT2009 code to properly support sort/unique while also 
      providing feature weight and/or order number arrays, next to the 
      feature hash array. I'm not too happy with the current solution, but 
      can't think of a better (faster) one now.

      A better approach might be to insert the feature hashes in an ordered 
      manner at creation time...

    * Fixed ssize_t / size_t portability issue for 64-bit Windows

    * Added the name of the classifier in the 'CLASSIFY fails' and 'CLASSIFY 
      succeeds' texts produced by any classifier to allow CRM script (or 
      attending human) to verify that the proper classifier is used (bug in 
      mail*.crm scripts would create empty OSB CSS databases, even when a 
      different classifier was set up in mailfilter.cf :clf:)

    * Added 'scoped variables' handling to the crm script interpreter: from 
      now on, any variables created at a call depth are only visible to that 
      (or deeper) call depths.

      The mailfilter/* scripts (and a few others, such as 
      tests/call_return_test*.crm) have been updated to properly set up 
      'outer scope' return variables (using 'isolate') accordingly.

    * Added test cases for the 'scoped variables' processing.

    * Augmented the 'crm -v' output to include a list of supported crm 
      script instructions, together with all their allowed flags and other 
      arguments. This functions as a crude sort of language spec.

    * Activated the crm script interpreter code which will properly handle 
      multiple traps triggered by a single statement: such traps/faults 
      should NOT jump to the Nth 'trap' catch instruction following the 
      offending line in the script, but just fall down to the next matching 
      trap and no further.

      This behaviour was due to an uncaring implementation of the fault 
      handling logic in the vanilla crm114 code, and consequently in the 
      GerH port. This deficiency has been remedied now. (vanilla crm114 
      didn't suffer from this misbehaviour as it simply doesn't check for 
      failures all that much. Once you introduce validation to the flag 
      decoding logic in vanilla, you'll get burned. To name but one 
      example.)

      Note the precedence of the various jumps in ascending order:

        goto
        fail
        fault / trap-pable error inside the code
        debugger jump ('j' instruction in the debugger window)

      This ensures that faults always prevail over mere 'goto' or 'fail'-
      eqv. instructions, while the debugger (human) always has the last 
      word.

    * Hash table sizes are now all proper primes, which are guaranteed to be 
    'relative prime' to any positive power of 2.

    * Unified hash multipliers are now all proper primes, which are thus 
      guaranteed to all be mutually 'relative prime' AND 'relative prime' to 
      any positive power of 2 as well. (Several values in hctable[] and 
      other places were not prime, nor mutually 'relative prime'.)

    * Fixed memmove() portability code, which mandates the use of 
      crm_memmmove() instead of memmove().

    * Fixed memory leak in the regex library wrapper code (crm_regcomp() + 
      crm_regfree()).

    * Changed classifier diagnositc code (internal_trace/user_trace) to 
      always report the absolute path of files for which an error is 
      reported.

    * crm will now search for an 'include' script in the directory where the 
      parent script resides, or, when it cannot be found there, looks for 
      the insert file in the current directory (-u / pwd). This prevents 
      quite some hassle when executing mailfilter/mailreaver/mailtrainer 
      scripts from a different directory, e.g. a data directory, like this, 
      for example:

        ../mailfilter/mailtrainer.crm --args ...

      which would cause a failure report to be displayed due to maillib.crm 
      which couldn't be located. This is now a problem in the past.

    * Several bugfixes and diagnostic code imporvements in the crm script 
      compiler.

    * Removed a sanity check in all classifiers which verified the CSS 
      specification contained a | bar: this is not necessary and more 
      particularly, is NOT USED when running multi-category categorization 
      tests, such as the ones possible with the tenfold_validation test 
      scripts.

    * Fixed coredumping bug in the debugger, which was due to stdin being 
      treated as a closeable connection, even when it is connected to the 
      TTY. In which case, SuSE 10.2 will dump core. This probably applies to 
      different platforms too.

    * Fixed some grave bugs in mk_absolute_path()

    * Fixed coredumping bug in untrappableerror() which would occur when 
      this function is called for failures which occur before the crm script 
      has even compiled yet.

    * Added the system crm script variable :_fault:, which is set to the 
      full error report text of the last (trappable) failure.

    * Fixed crm_invoke(), which edits the CSL. These edits would not make it 
      outside the scope of crm_invoke() itself, resulting in unexpected 
      script execution failures further down the road, when traps/faults are 
      triggered within a 'call' and the trap/fault 'return's from the callee 
      depth level to the caller.

    * Fixed the set of allowwable flags with each crm script instruction in 
      the compiler instruction definition table.

    * Fixed bug in diagnostics output for 'match', which would previously 
      dump unlimited amounts of data and/or coredump.

    * Unified the markovian/osb/osbf/winnow classify report code section as 
      far as possible; this is the first stage towards providing a unified 
      bayesian/markovian classifier in the form of 
      alt.markovian/alt.osb/alt.osbf/alt.winnow.

    * Several important bug fixes for the Neural Net classifier. Also 
      removed some unneccesary calls to lookup helper functions in the NN 
      code.

    * Implemented a (minor) speed improvement in the NN code by jumping the 
      feature collection for each stored document in the CSS file while 
      scanning for a matching document, etc.

    * Added pR offset setup through the second // argument for the 
      markovian, osb, osbf, winnow and hyperspace classifiers. (And their 
      alt.* equivalents as well.)

      NOTE: 'osb' and 'osbf' already had this before. Now the others have it 
            as well. The pR offset value is used to determine which classify 
            pR result values will trigger a script 'fail' operation (and 
            which values don't).

    * Fixed bugs in crm preprocessor code.

    * Added hash method #6: the OpenSSL string hash function.

    * Added run-time validation of commandline-based script variables, i.e. 
      --var=value, where 'var' may NOT contain any ':' colon.

    * maillib.cm / mailfilter.cf now supports both

        :arg: /value/

      and

        :arg: [value]

      specifications in mailfilter.cf (similar to the new 'isolate' 
      instruction), thus allowing for paths to be specified without the need 
      to escape the '/' directory seperators.
      
    * Removed the check for /usr/share/dict/words, which was used in a few
      crm114 script test files (match_isolate_*.crm) but it turns out this
      is a VERY dangerous file to use as each UNIX system has its own version,
      all different sizes and some UNIX systems don't carry this item AT ALL
      (especially secure servers which have minimal contents to reduce
      abuse risk).
      
      Consequently, the use of this file has been discarded in the relevant 
      test scripts. (Thanks to Jason White and Eric S. Johansson reporting.)

    * Merged in BlameBarack vanilla changes since 2008/10.

    * Notice that the unification of mailfilter + mailreaver + mailtrainer 
      has an unexpected side-effect: mailfilter would add the 'X-CRM114-
      Status: Good  ( <pr> )' mail header while the more modern mailreaver 
      would add the 'X-CRM114-Status: GOOD ( <pr> )' mail header, which is 
      SIMILAR but NOT IDENTICAL.

      This vanilla issue turned up while working on TREC-compatible tests 
      using the Gordon Cormack / Lyman published spamfilterjig toolkit, 
      which expected this instead: 'X-CRM114-Status: GOOD  ( pR: -<pr> )' 
      ... notice that extra 'pR:' string AND the mandatory '-' minus in 
      there!

    * Added the mkcss.crm script (derived from work on TREC-compatible 
      tests)

    * Added tenfold_validate_ex.crm and tenfold_validate_mailreaver.crm 
      scripts to ./tests/ directory. tenfold_validate_ex spits out TREC-
      compatible result files and includes additional features, such as 
      'forced training' (Train Always) vs. the regular TOE (Train On Error). 
      Another option is THTTR (Thick Threshold Training) which will 
      repeatedly (for a maximum number of iterations) train a message until 
      its classification passes a preconfigured 'thick' threshold.

    * alt.winnow classifier has some VERY EXPERIMENTAL new pR calculus.

    * Added vanilla CRM114 bug exhibiting tests in ./tests/ directory: 
      vanilla_*.crm

    * Fixed the trap-within-a-call handling bug in GerH builds. Test added 
      to ./tests/ directory: trap_inside_call_issue1

    * Hyperspace-style <unique> has been moved into the VT engine so that 
      any classifier using VT now automagically supports the <unique> 
      attribute as well.

    * Bugfix: script parser would not accept the Bayesian/Markovian 
      'alternative' classifiers (markovian.alt, osb.alt, osbf.alt and 
      winnow.alt) as arguments of the 'learn', 'classify' nor the 'css*' 
      script commands.

    * The experimental Bayesian/Markovian 'alternative' classifiers 
      (markovian.alt, osb.alt, osbf.alt and winnow.alt) now include full VT 
      support.

    * VT engine has been extended to include configurable leading and 
      trailing padding in the tokenizer (vanilla uses hardcoded DEADBEEF 
      trailing padding only).

      It is the intent to make the padding script-configurable to enable 
      quick & easy testing of various edge behaviours of the VT engine; this 
      is expected to be quite important when classifying small messages.

    * VT engine has been augmented to include feature hash weight factors 
      and order number feedback to allow Bayesian/Markovian classifiers 
      full, backwards-compatible VT use.

      Of course, feature weight lists can be script-configured, just like VT 
      matrices already could (weight:, vector:)

    * VT engine now detects and signals when Arne's optimization is feasible 
      as this depends very much on the VT matrix contents.

    * All Bayesian / Markovian classifiers now use the same left-trucatable 
      prime as their default hashtable/CSS store size.


2008-10-20 Ger Hobbelt

    * Added Bourne Shell fixes for those systems which have the original 
      Bourne shell as /bin/sh:

      '[...]' is replaced with 'test ...' -- Bourne doesn't recognize the [] 
                                             alias

      'shift' is surrounded by 'if test $# != 0; then ... fi' as 'shift' 
      will print an error and abort in Bourne when there are no more 
      arguments to shift (BASH will silently ignore this)

      '\n' in tests/Makefile CRM114 inline test scripts is replaced by 
      CRM114's :*:_nl: as Bourne unescapes the \n even within '...' quotes 
      and that ruins our test validations (bash and bourne produced output 
      is not similar when you keep those \n around instead of using :*:_nl:)

      added check for the existence of '/usr/share/dict/words' as not all 
      systems have that one and not having it around would previously result 
      in an aborted (FAILed) 'make check'.

    * bugfixes for mawk vs. gawk in ./tests/*.awk:

      - gawk accepts /* .. */ comments, mawk does not.

      - gawk understands sprintf("%.0lf", ...), mawk does not. For mawk to 
        work it must be: %.0f without the 'l'.


2008-10-04 Ger Hobbelt

    * Added a few extra test cases to 'make check': alius_w_comment2, ...

    * Updated the makefiles to make sure that all MSVC/Windows required 
      files are included in the distro (some projects were lacking). (NOTE: 
      mandatory libraries are not included; there available as separate 
      downloads at http://hebbut.net/ )


2008-10-02 / 2008-09-** Ger Hobbelt

    * Full review of mailreaver/mailtrainer/mailfilter/maillib.crm and user 
      request resulted in a new version with several fixes to both scripts 
      and C source code. Script fixes include the important upgrade for 
      mailtrainer, which now uses the exact mail preprocessing code as 
      mailreaver, so that mailtrainer does NOT use a message with its 
      content duplicated for learning and re-classification.

    * Added '--dontstore' non-cached classification and training support to 
    mailreaver + mailtrainer.

    * Integrated almost all still missing mailfilter features (e.g. 
      forwarding to error-handling email address) to mailreaver. NOT 
      INCLUDED: special 'secured' command mail processing; '--learn' 
      handling, '--unlearn' handling, 'automatic' training.

      Extra mailfilter.CF options:

        # mailfilter log options:
        :log_to_nonspamtext: /yes/
        :log_to_spamtext: /yes/


    * mail***.crm '--help' command line option now always is detected and 
      processed, no matter its position on the command line.

    * Fixed Makefiles, scripts and ./configure to properly support 'make 
      install'; now bang lines will ensure the *installed* crm114 binary 
      will be used to execute them. When you want to use a different crm114 
      binary, you should run the script as

        path-to/crm114 your_script.crm

    * Extra mailfilter.CF configuration parameters added:

            #
            # specify your system's 'mail' command:
            #
            # Should support the commandline
            #   <to_address> -s <subject>
            # and content via stdin.
            :mail: /mail/

      and

            :do_refute_training: /SET/

    * Made darn sure the message content passed to crm*expand() functions is 
      NUL terminated, no matter what.

      This prevents spurious crashes and extra weird character output when 
      running in -t and/or -T mode.

    * Fix for crm script 'input' statement when filename is constructed 
      using a crm expression which is itself larger than the maximum allowed 
      filepath on your OS.

    * FAILED ATTEMPT to get rid of the global variables; tdw and vht are now 
      generally passed as extra arguments, but this not sufficient; there 
      are a zillion spots in the code which require almost all globals 
      (error handling/reporting routines), which will bloat the call 
      interfaces tremendously when we'd continued with this particular 
      effort.

      ABORTED EFFORT.

    * Fix for fringe case in 'isolate' statement regarding buffer overruns.

    * script 'match' fix for <newend>.

    * script 'match' addition: now <fromend>/<fromstart>, etc. can all be 
      mixed instead of only the last one being used with warning that extra 
      (previous) attributes would be discarded.

      Provisional fix for <backwards> as well, but this has not been tested 
      yet.

    * Fix for failing 'syscall': serious application invoke errors are now 
      non-trappable as the system state is undeterminable by then anyhow.

    * Fix for fringe case buffer overrun error in 'window' script statement 
      where one would specify illegally large variable names.

    * Important FIX for FSCM: now with corrected VT invocation. The existing 
      situation would produce extremely corrupted hash feature series and 
      core dumps in particular circumstances.

    * Fix for several fringe case buffer overrun errors in Markovian 
      classifier.

    * Fix memory mapped access request for the Markovian classify statement: 
      read-only access - as it should be.

    * Fix for memory and resource leaks in Markovian classifier.

    * Update for the crm script :@: operator: the '=' equality compare 
      operation will try to cope with the slight errors which will occur in 
      classifiers as they use floating point arithmatic. The equal operator 
      will now compare the values within a band of FLT_EPSILON.

    * Fix for Win64 versus Linux 64-bit printf() operations in the crm114 
      script math operator :@:

    * Fix for OSB <refute> learncount updates in the CSS databases; before, 
      illegal NEGATIVE values could easily occur, thus destroying your CSS 
      databases completely.

    * Fixes for Markovian repeated for OSB Bayes, Winnow and OSBF 
      classifiers.

    * Important FIX for Hyperspace VT: same as for FSCM (see above).

    * Fixed Hyperspace 'learn': would always print some '-t' output, even 
      when '-t' was NOT enabled.

    * Fixed bug where script statements such as 'input' would try to store 
      too much data into a variable: now such failures are properly 
      trappable, as originally intended.

    * VERSIONING HEADER *update* now also stores the 'REVISION' to assist 
      future migration operations. This BREAKS the current versioned CSS 
      format, but we can better break it now, when few people use it, then 
      later when folks truely depend on it.

    * TESTS: added several script tests which verify additional normal and 
      illegal behaviours.

    * configure: now also reports the install directory when done. This is 
      done to help users who compile crm114 GerH from source and wish to 
      know where their binaries are going to end up.

    * Fixed the distribute_files_from_src_dir.sh script which redistributes 
      Bill's scripts in ./src/

    * configure: added the [sub]category testset make targets to the main 
      'make' file for ease of use:

            megatest_ng:
            timing_tests:
            test_megatest:
            test_megatest_ng:
            test_basics:
            test_other:
            test_mailfilter:

            script:

2008-07-17 Ger Hobbelt

    * Fixed Makefiles, scripts and ./configure to fully support VPATH: e.g. 
      you can now build and test CRM114 from a specific (different) build 
      directory, using this sequence for example:

        mkdir _build
        cd _build
        ../configure --srcdir=..
        make
        make check

    * Added 'statistics gathering' (I called it 'profiling' when I wrote it 
      about a month ago, but that name has so many re-uses here, and 
      besides, 'statistics gathering' covers much better what it actually 
      does) to OSB; I intend to add it to the other classifiers too for deep 
      analysis support.

      With that comes a new tool to process these 'data traces' into useful 
      numbers and graphs.

      Currently, the tool only produces some stats and some crudy ASCII art, 
      but that's just the start.

      'Statistics gathering' this way has been chosen in order to permit 
      'tracing' multiple runs on CRM114 with the absolute minimum of extra 
      load caused by 'collecting' the information. A separate tool has been 
      written as I believe the data processing should NOT occur in CRM114 
      itself; I envision two major output channels, both for processing 
      large quantities of data into human-parsable stats and graphs: number 
      series and/or scripts, which should be fed to R (the Open Source 'S'-
      equivalent statistics package) and a second feed of a rather more 
      novel type: rendered video. For that purpose, a future version of the 
      processing tool will have a dependency on OpenEXR, as the HDRI nature 
      of that particular format is especially suited to display data with a 
      wide dynamic range.

    * Taking care of 'make check' and other 'make' test targets' verbosity: 
      a few environment variables have been introduced:

        CRM114_MAKE_SCRIPTS_DEBUG=1
        export CRM114_MAKE_SCRIPTS_DEBUG

      ... and, yes, don't forget that 'export' statement or it won't work 
      within 'make': full verbosity for when you wih to debug the 
      test/filter scripts themselves. (tests/testscript.sh.in + 
      tests/crm114*filter.sh.in test output filter scripts) 'unset 
      CRM114_MAKE_SCRIPTS_DEBUG' will turn test script debugging verbosity 
      OFF again.

        CRM114_CHECK_QUIET=1
        export CRM114_CHECK_QUIET

      Don't forget to assign it a non-zero number to turn it ON; setting it 
      to '0' or 'unset'ting it will turn this option OFF: when ON, don't 
      show diff reports unless we've got a test that FAILs.

      In other words: use CRM114_CHECK_QUIET=1;export CRM114_CHECK_QUIET to 
      shut up 'make check' et al, so you only see al list of test titles and 
      'OK's flowing by - until you hit a FAIL, which will show you WHY it 
      failed (diff output between actual output and reference (= expected) 
      output.

    * Test script / 'make check' notes:

      A) hassle-free refreshing / updating test references

      the generic test script has been designed so that both testing AND 
      refreshing reference data is a breathe: simply delete (or move) the 
      reference data in ./tests/ref and the testscript will automatically 
      copy the test outputs for the next runs to the reference directory 
      (while printing a warning for each test reference which is updated in 
      this way). Of course, you can also delete a single reference file: the 
      next time this test is performed, its test result will be used as 
      reference from then on.

      Procedure when validating new test results as 'correct' and old 
      results as 'NOT correct anymore' is thus:

        rm tests/ref/<testname>.*
        make check          (or other 'make <testtarget>' which tests <testname>)

      to update the reference.

      Any subsequent 'make check' or other 'make <testtarget>' which tests 
      <testname> will use that reference to test as usual.


      B) test filters to cope with permissable variations in test output

      The generic test script comes with a set of 'filter' scripts to 
      'postprocess' test output, BEFORE that output is fed to a comparator 
      (diff). In fact, when you specify a filter script (4th commandline 
      argument for testscript.sh) the testscript assumes the filter WILL 
      ALSO PERFORM THE COMPARISON ITSELF. This is done to allow the filter 
      scripts to compare output with reference in other ways that are not 
      possible with UNIX diff. Hence, the exit value of the filter script is 
      used as a OK/FAIL signal: 0 = OK, anything else = FAIL.

      Note that the filter scripts accept custom environment variables to 
      drive their behaviour (see tests/Makefile.am for several examples of 
      this, especially with the classifier tests).

      The generic testscript itself also accepts an additional environment 
      variable:

        CRM114_CHECK_OVERRIDE=0; export CRM114_CHECK_OVERRIDE;

      which can also be used as part of a 'make' action (see 
      tests/Makefile.am for several examples) to 'override' the test 
      results. In effect, those tests are thus completely overriden; they do 
      execute, but since we know their results are buggy / instable, we can 
      prevent those tests from aborting test sets of which they are part. 
      ('make check' and other 'make' test targets will stop at the first 
      FAILed test.)

      Note that the value assigned to CRM114_CHECK_OVERRIDE is used as the 
      'permanent' test result; 0=OK, any other value will cause a 
      'permanent' failure.

    * All major/medium test targets have been 'exported' down to the root 
      Makefile, so you don't need to 'cd tests' anymore to run a particular 
      set of tests.

    * Upgraded the custom M4 macros and otherwise pushed the autoconf bits 
      into the Century of the Fruitbat, kicking and screaming.

      Seriously, the compiler flags, etc. are working as expected. Finally. 
      And all this goodness requires autoconf 2.62 or beyond now, so stay 
      abreast, my dears.

    * UNIX: CRM114 'syscall' acted up and barfed in the tests; amazingly 
      this hadn't happened before, but it turns out it's a big difference if 
      you compile with no optimizations (because the configure script did 
      not properly check for them) or suddenly have access to -O3 / -O2 
      optimized binaries.

      Turns out there's an uninitialized variable in there.

      While at it, checked the waitpid() man page, decided NOT to check the 
      return value depite my anal retentive preferences in that regard, but 
      instead made sure the error report now shows the correct info as 
      children can also be aborted in various ways.

    * GCC 3 produced wads of warnings when finally -O3 was turned on. A 
      single warning was particularly annoying and happened only in those 
      places where I had overriden the free() function to ensure that the 
      pointer passed to it is also NULLed once done do prevent any remaining 
      code from accessing unalloced memory anymore - at least for the usual 
      cases of such.

         warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-
                  aliasing rules

      Turns out the warning is not useful, but it took a bit of work to get 
      rid of it. This required the use of GCC specific code constructs, 
      which have bee properly encapsulated in crm114_sysincludes.h

    * Added Neural Net tests to 'make check' again. Thanks to the new random 
      generator, these don't take 15 whole minutes anymore: first test 
      fails, second succeeds - within tolerances. (See tests/Makefile.am)


2008-05-21 Ger Hobbelt

    * Added the match_re_fringe1.crm test case after some new discoveries 
      regarding crm114 matching and variable rewriting which caught me 
      unaware.

    * mailtrainer.crm had a bad return statement, which nevertheless worked 
      out in the old days as all CRM114 variables have global scope are the 
      called function used the same variable as the caller. Harumph.

    * QUICKREF.txt now includes preliminary documentation for the new CRM
      statement:

        cssmigrate (:report:) [:src:] (:dst:) /params/

      This is not yet implemented, but intended to load and convert vanilla
      CSS files for production classifiers and convert those files to
      something 'native' for the GerH builds on all platforms, both 32- and
      64-bit.

    * Added extra syntax checks for liaf/fail/alius script commands in the
      script compiler to warn script programmers of misuse of these: these
      commands expect to live in a {} block.

    * Fixed the compiler to properly handle MSDOS formatted script code: the
      number of generated opcodes would sometimes overflow the pre-allocated
      space without warning, resulting in silently(!) truncated scripts when
      CRM114 was fed CRLF-line terminated code. (This is very probably a bug
      introduced by yours truly when starting work on the script
      compiler. :-( )

    * '-T' mode now dumps the compiled opcodes of the script with all
      attributes for further analysis.

    * Tweaked the FAIL targets to NOT point past the last valid line of script
      anymore as the debugger would not like such a thing.

      As we have the extra empty line added to every loaded script anyhow, the
      outer-most FAIL target will be that empty line.

      This does not make a difference to the script execution; it is merely to
      keep the debugger a bit simpler (it is already complex enough) and still
      allowing the debugger to catch possible crm-internal compiler errors.

    * Fixed the debugger to allow it to have command line history recall on
      UNIX when 'readline()' is available. This now makes the debugger as
      capable on readline-enabled UNIX systems as it already was on Win32.

    * Added the mk_absolute_path() function to the code for cross-platform
      filepath expansion. Can be used to report the precise filepaths for
      files which report access failures, etc. - sometimes files can be found
      in several places on your discs and then it is handy to know _exactly_
      which file crm114 has been looking for.

    * Few minor fixes in the error reporting functions, following a partial
      code review, and added (int) typecasts to strlen() and other functions
      which produce 'size_t' results, which are fed into 'int' targets. This
      has been done to reduce the number of warnings when compiling this code
      in pedantic mode on UNIX and Win32/64 platforms.

    * fixed code for eval to ensure we have at least a chance at retrieving a
      valid variable name (where the empty var '::' is also accepted) using
      the generally applied coding pattern:

        len = crm_get_pgm_arg(varname, MAX_VARNAME, apb->p1start, apb->p1len);
        len = crm_nexpandvar(varname, len, MAX_VARNAME);
        if (!crm_nextword(varname, len, 0, &varnamestart, &varnamelen) || varnamelen < 2)
        {
            // we do accept the special 'empty var' :: here as a valid var: it does exist after all :-)
            nonfatalerror("bla bla bla");
        }

      As it is, this should rather be packaged into a 'get_variable_name()'
      wrapper call or something, because we still don't check for proper ':'
      delimiting, so code like this is okayed by the compiler but produces
      inaccessible results (or other errors):

        alter (x) /foo/   #note the lacking : : around the 'x'

    * Code has been reviewed for the variable fetch pattern descried above;
      several other spots have seen minor edits too. (e.g. 'isolate',
      'window')

    * FSCM contained code to accept \-escaped whitespace in filenames, but
      only in 'classify'. This recurred in the apparent copy&paste Neural Net
      code which had the same 'feature'.

      REMOVED.

      (Until we re-introduce such a feature in a later release, but then for
      all filenames in script parameters everywhere.)

    * Cleaned up OSB a little bit (RIDICULOUS_CODE): there was some old stuff
      in there that would not do what it was expected to in non-standard
      situations anyway, so it could be easily discarded.

    * Removed the last few remaining vestiges of this abomination to fetch a
      word from string space:

        while (htext[i] < 0x021)
            i++;
        j = i;
        while (htext[j] >= 0x021)
            j++;

    * '-T' mode now dumps the (pre-)processed script code with line numbers
      for easier analysis of medium and large scripts.

    * Added Marsaglias CMWC RNG code to have a cross-platform reproducible
      good quality random generator: rand() is non-portable. This showed in
      the Neural Net tests; that classifier requires a little 'noise' to
      settle; the new CMWC was chosen because it is fast, has good random
      characteristics and is very portable so that test results can be
      compared properly across platforms (32/64 UNIX/WIN).

      As I am a lazy bum, I took the implementation from here:

        http://www.agner.org/random/

      which is GPL'd code so should be okay license-wise inside CRM114.

    * Fixed script command flags decoder routine crm_flagparse() so it would
      not cause the code to jump multiple traps when several flags would
      report an error.

      Come to think of it, I should rather make sure the nonfatal() code (and
      other bits) NEVER get a chance to jump several trap targets as multiple
      errors are reported by a single script command being executed.

      HMMMMM....

      Ah well, a single message for several flags being not allowed or
      otherwise faulty is an improvement anyhow.

    * DITCHED the special code for the tools from the Win32 and UNIX builds in
      a pre-emptive move towards including those features inside CRM114
      itself. Too much trouble to keep these up-to-date when I know their
      lifetime is severely limited.

      crm_util_errorhandlers.c is now officialy obsoleted and discarded from
      the distribution.

    * Fixed CRM114 to ALWAYS check if the :_env_PWD: and :_env_USER: global
      vars can be set from the environment variables. If not, set these using
      system calls so as to guarantee that both are set and at least filled
      with _something_ that's probably valid when the actual script is
      executed.

    * Added part of the vanilla VT code into the VT source so I can better
      validate the test results against megatest_knowngood.log - the new VT
      code includes some (I think) bug fixes which make it produce a slightly
      different number of features, which results in different test results.
      And that annoys 'make check' too much.

    * Had been a bit too enthousiastic with applying the crmhash_t type
      throughout the VT code: now the coefficients have the regular 'int' type
      they should have had from the start.

    * Fixed dumb bug in VT code when custom vectors are supplied. 'make check'
      is happy again.

    * MAILREAVER/MAILTRAINER/MAILFILER: preliminary port to Win32 included.

    * MAILFILTER.CF: BASE64 decoding is now DISabled by default; this is just
      for testing (though I found OSBF has a provision for big token
      clustering into a single feature, so only emails with human readable
      content encoded as BASE64 are adversily affected by this move when you
      don't revert it in production - note that the new VT tokenizer also
      includes this 'big token clustering' feature).

    * There a better way to keep the vanilla and Win32 build header files in
      sync regarding build numbers, etc.: now these have been added to the
      configure script so I don't have to update them by hand every time
      (which I often forgot).

    * Fixed bug in crm114_classify.filter.awk test result postprocessing
      script, which made the Correlate classifier tests barf.


2008-05-05 Ger Hobbelt

    * Of course I had to screw up again. Apparently I did never hit any error
      reports larger than ~ 256 characters going, as when I was taking the
      next step towards a single-scan compiler, a bug in fwrite4stdio() caught
      me behind the ear: error messages and other displays would repeat after
      256 chars instead of printing the _complete_ message. FIXED.

    * Compiler now comes with full argument parsing and argument count
      validation using the table in crm_compiler.c. Of course, one may expect
      trouble then and several troubles have already been addressed in the
      table and the validation code.

      Basically, JIT is dead and gone now.

      The things left TODO:

      - get rid of the preprocessor

      - make the mct[] array a single allocated array instead of a series of
        blocks - no use having that

      - refactor the code, such that calls like crm_statement_parse() do not
        needlessly rescan the command too, or rather have it's state machine
        parse the complete command for us as it does that already basically:
        this functionality is duplicated in several ways in both the
        preprocessor and the compiler core.

    * Fixed a few bugs in the latest boundary checking and error reporting
      code. This was not catched by 'make check' and I just found out when
      trying to run mailreaver.crm - oops. :-(( Definitely in need of a more
      sophisticated test set to prevent this sort of boogers.

    * Further preparation for the css* commands in the CRM114 compiler: the
      compiler should now be able to cope with 'non standard flags', i.e.
      ignore them when the statement definition table (crm_compiler.c) says we
      should expect them for this particular command.

    * Programming bugs in the vanilla test scripts:

        fataltraptest.crm --> an extra fataltrapprogramerr.crm test case has
                              been created to test this situation, while
                              fataltraptest.crm has been fixed to perform the
                              intended tests.

        +Too many angled '<>' arguments were specified for this command: we see you specified 1 args while the maximum required is 0.
        +Sorry, but this program is very sick and probably should be killed off.
        +This happened at line 14 of file overalterisolatedtest.crm:
        +    alter <> (:z:) /:*:2:/
        +(runtime system location: crm_stmt_parser.c(630) in routine: crm_statement_parse)

        --> overalterisolatedtest.crm has been fixed to adhere.

        +crm114: *ERROR*
        +Too many slashes '//' arguments were specified for this command: we see you specified 2 args while the maximum required is 1.
        +Sorry, but this program is very sick and probably should be killed off.
        +This happened at line 6 of file exectest.crm:
        +    syscall ( ) (:lsout:) /ls *.c/ /[Windows-MS]dir *.c /
        +(runtime system location: crm_stmt_parser.c(651) in routine: crm_statement_parse)

        --> exectest.crm has been fixed too: this was my own mistake as I
            hadn't removed the old Win32 syscall hack in there. :-(

            This code does not run (anymore when ever it did) on Win32 as it
            is; I should code an extra bit code in there to check that
            hosttype and make it Win32 compatible the /proper/ way.

        +crm114: *ERROR*
        +Too many slashes '//' arguments were specified for this command: we see you specified 2 args while the maximum required is 1.
        +Sorry, but this program is very sick and probably should be killed off.
        +This happened at line 10 of file randomiotest.crm:
        +    syscall /rm -f randtst.txt/  /[Windows-MS]del randtst.txt/
        +(runtime system location: crm_stmt_parser.c(651) in routine: crm_statement_parse)

        --> one more of my own legacy boogers. I *LIKE* the new compiler
            already. :-) Yes, I do!

        +crm114: *ERROR*
        +Too few angled '<>' arguments were specified for this command: we see you specified 0 args while the minimum required is 1.
        +Sorry, but this program is very sick and probably should be killed off.
        +This happened at line 2 of file (from command line):
        +    learn (q_test.css) /[[:graph:]]+/
        +(runtime system location: crm_stmt_parser.c(630) in routine: crm_statement_parse)

        --> heck, this was legal in the old days, right? The new CRM114 has a
            dummy 'autodetect' call in there, which does not do any
            autodetecting at all but just point to the old default. Which is
            another way of saying it's a work in progress, that. Nevertheless,
            this should stay, so the compiler definitions will be fixed for
            this. Fixed in the compiler table.

    * Fixed configure.ac as 7zip was suddenly unrecognized since a few
      releases. :-(


2008-05-01 Ger Hobbelt

    * BillY-equivalent src makefile is now renamed to

         Makefile.vanilla

      to better signify the raison-d-etre for this file: a 'vanilla UNIX
      setup' for those who won't or can't compile the ./configure-based set.

      With that comes an appropriately preconfigured config headerfile and
      #define to turn this on - set by default in src/Makefile.vanilla, of
      course:

          #define            : ORIGINAL_VANILLA_UNIX_MAKEFILE
          #include headefile : "config_vanilla_UNIX_sys_defaults.h"

    * CHANGE: now all :@:: and :+:: accepting script elements also accept :#::
      - it was very handy to be able to print string/variable content length
      in output /.../ statements, that's why.

    * CHANGE: Vector Tokenizer now accepts 3D vector matrices (i.e. multiple
              matrices for stride != 1 processes), comes with its own
              structures to define cutom tokenizer functions for use by the
              tokenizer and the code has been completely refactored to
              facilitate these new features in the best possible way.

      Currently the VT code accepts up to 4 2D vector matrices in parallel;
      currenty published classifiers only use 2. This is a compile-time
      constant:

         #define UNIFIED_VECTOR_STRIDE 4

    * Fixed input line handling for MSDOS & older MAC which do not use the
      UNIX LF ('\n') line termination, but CRLF and CR respectively.
      (crm_expr_file_io.c)

    * CHANGE: speed improvement for Win32 stdio by removing the fflush()
      calls, which are useless anyway.

      WARNING: those statement proved not THAT useless: without them the
               syscall command would keep repeating previously generated
               output when stdout is redirected to file.

               See also the crm114 dev mailing list; suffice to say that after
               a long time looking for the cause of this isse, the _proper_
               fflush() calls were added to the syscall() code itself - where
               they _should_ be.

               (Though I hate think of a fork()ing system which requires these
               stricks to keep things going smoothly; that's one of the
               reasons why I personally avoid fork() like the Plague; it's
               only useful in very particular circumstances and besides, Win32
               doesn't have fork() at all, so fork()ing code is rather
               unportable to boot. Use threads or other modern
               multitasking/async I/O means instead.)

    * Win32 does NOT like writing (fwrite(), ...) large amounts of data to
      stdout/err at once (errors happen beyond 64K at least, sometimes
      earlier, depending on your setup and Win32 platform). This has been
      fixed by repelacing relevant calls by the new function:

          fwrite4stdio()

      which writes the data in 'reasonable' chunks. 'reasonable' is calculated
      as about half of a regular FILE buffer. This provides no noticable
      performance losses on either Win32 or Linux (SuSe64).

    * SKS/SVM: removed useless expandvar() calls for the filename regexes.

    * SCM: removed fro the source tree and make files: this code was already
      long time antiquated and does not show up in the BillY releases anyway.

    * FSCM: file I/O data structures have been made cross-platform portable
      using [u]int32_t and other fixed-width data types; other classifiers
      already had this treatment but this one had apparently slipped the
      dance.

    * The error handling routines now 'know' when we're inside the debugger,
      so failures in watched expressions (which can easily happen ;-) ) won't
      have side-effects such as execution of trap handlers in the script
      itself (ouch!).

    * compiler checks (table in crm_compiler.c) have been corrected for some
      of the more modern (experimental) classifiers.

    * Improved the debugger and updated QUICKREF.txt accordingly.

    * Added the debugger-related script system variable

        :_?:

      which contains the latest error message from the CRM114 run.

    * Debugger now also pops up when the complete script has run so the
      debuggeee/user can view the last results before the application
      terminates. Sometimes code jump commands may still work, though the
      complete context cannot be reset of course (feed from stdin, etc.).

    * Debugger 'v' command: line range handling split off to a separate
      routine; now handles a more flexible format too (every number can be
      'defaulted').

    * CRM114 error reports now also show the offending source code in print.

    * Did we now finally stamp out all the boundary bugs in expandvar()? --
      This following a bug report by Jason Lewis, which showed a boundary bug
      in vanilla CRM114, but upon renewed inspection I found the GerH copy
      still could also suffer from boundary issues (though is fewer, rather
      obscure conditions, yet a boundary bug is one too many anyhow).

      This build includes fixes for all known/detected boundary issues in
      there (see for a list of similar material in the calling code further
      below), including fixes for coping with extremely large variable names
      which need :@: or other processing.

      KNOWN BUG: nested :@: statements are not parsed properly, e.g.

        eval /:@::@:1+1::/

      does not produce what you'd expect ('2'); this is important to
      know when using the CRM114 debugger as the watched expressions use
      the same expandvar() routine to produce their results. See
      crm_debugger.c

    * Following discussion about the need to escape other characters in
      any crm114 command arg, here's the comment from crm_Expandvar.c
      (that one again):

        //
        // As 'datastring' points to a text buffer which has - of course -
        // already been \-de-escaped, we perform a little trick here to
        // prevent requiring the user to specify double \-escaped '/'
        // slashes in his/her restriction regex: since we know we're
        // the only regex in this box, we do this by walking back from the
        // end of the string, looking for the last '/' there is.
        //

    * Checked all malloc/calloc/realloc/strdup class and added
      untrappableerror) statements for those spots which did not check
      for NULL returns - which would otherwise lead to
      crashes/coredumps.

    * expandvar() code cleanup - at least a bit.

      KNOWN BUG: ":@: :@: 1 + 1 ::" is not handled properly by
                 expandvar: nested match expressions in an 'eval'
                 statement screw up BADLY.

      TODO: for performance reasons, the quad loop through the buffer
            for each expansion should be reduced to a single round only.
            This can be nicely combined with the fix for KNOWN BUG
            above.

    * debugger: 'c' restored to its proper glory: 'c' without any arg
      should just GO. We've got 'n' for single stepping, don't we?

    * UNIX syscall: KNOWN BUG: some weirdness is now occurring when
                               crm114 scripts execute syscall and their
                               own output is redirected to file (such as
                               for the 'make check' testcases): it looks
                               like the crm114 output buffer gets
                               rewritten to stdout completely, every
                               time a syscall is executed. :-S

    * makefiles/configure: upgraded to the latest autoconf/automake/etc.

      KNOWN BUGS: some of the AX_... macros use undocumented
                  AC_RUN_LOG() which does not exist anymore in the
                  latest release.

                  This must be fixed (diff commandline flag checks and a
                  few others suffer from this)

    * makefiles: 'make dist' will not work from a VPATH-style setup (see
      automake/autoconf manuals for what VPATH is).

      'make distcheck' does not fail on this, but you can see it happen
      when running this check.

    * makefiles: 'make check' target now does something VERY useful: it
      runs all the megatest tests (except Neural Net) as separate tests.
      See tests/Makefile.am for the individual make targets: use these
      to test only a subset of the available tests -- very handy when
      debugging a certain bit of code or classifier.

      This is another step towards a complete 'standardized' make/conf
      setup:


        ./bootstrap      <-- for maintainers only!

        ./configure

        make

        make check

        make install

        make clean

      and for maintainers the extra:

        make distcheck

        make dist

        make distclean

    * KNOWN BUG: 'make distcheck' does not really like my 'alternative'
                 .tar.gz distro archive naming scheme, so it barfs after
                 running most of the tests.

                 This needs to be fixed.

    * Win32: KNOWN BUG: syscall() is b0rked: generally it'll work, but
             there are certain spurious conditions related to the OS and
             environment which can cause the current code to hang
             forever.

             This should be fixed by moving to the new fully async
             hnadling scheme -- not ready for release that yet. :-(

    * makefiles: if you want a verbose 'make check', i.e. when you want
      to debug the scripts, do so using the environment variable:

         CRM114_MAKE_SCRIPTS_DEBUG=1; export CRM114_MAKE_SCRIPTS_DEBUG;

    * makefiles/tests: a new testscript.sh[.in] test driver has been
      added. This driver is used to run the individual tests; several
      specialized postprocessing filter scripts (using SED and AWK)
      having been added too, so results of a test can be validated in a
      flexible way. For example, see this classifier test which takes
      certain floating point issues into account upon auto-
      comparison/validation:

        Support_Vector_Machine_Unigram_test1: $(TEST_PREREQUISITES) test_timing_seconds_announcement
            $(E) "*******************************************"
            $(E) "* Support Vector Machine (SVM) unigram classifier "
            $(E) "*******************************************"
            [...]
            $(SILENT)\
            CRM114_CHECK_FILTER_ARGS="-v prob=0.1 -v pR=0.2"; export CRM114_CHECK_FILTER_ARGS; \
            ./testscript.sh '-{ isolate (:s:); {classify < svm unigram unique > ( i_test.css | q_test.css | i_vs_q_test.css ) (:s:) /[[:graph:]]+/ /0 0 100 1e-3 1 0.5 1 1/ [:_dw:]   ; output / type I \n:*:s:\n/} alius { output / type Q \n:*:s:\n/ } }' \
                $(srcdir)/mt_ng_Support_Vector_Machine_SVM_unigram_1.input \
                $(refdir)/Support_Vector_Machine_Unigram_test1.step4.refoutput \
                $(builddir)/crm114_classify.filter.sh
            [...]

      Note the CRM114_CHECK_FILTER_ARGS environment variable in there
      which sets custom AWK variables to configure the custom AWK/SH
      postprocess filter script 'crm114_classify.filter.sh' to tolerate
      a certain spread in 'prob' probability and 'pR' values. See also
      the 'crm114_classify.filter.awk' AWK script which does the
      postprocessing.

      The concept
      -----------

      testscript.sh is the main driver: it starts CRM114 with the
      specified script (either file or 'literal' '-{...}' script code;
      feed CRM114 any specified input file/literal text over stdin and
      store the stdout and stderr output in temporary files, which are
      merged with the CRM114 exit code into a template file, which is
      fed, together with its equivalent reference file from the
      tests/ref/ directory, to the postprocessing section: this is
      either a custom script wich compares both files, or standard UNIX
      diff. Any differences found are reported to the console and will
      cause cause the test to 'FAIL'. A match with the reference file
      will produce and 'OK' instead.

      The only custom postprocessing/diff script at this date which
      accepts extra parameters is crm114_classify.filter.sh, which gets
      its extra args through aforementioned environment variable.

      The other custom scripts (tests/ref/*.filter.sh) serve particular
      purposes and don't require parameterization.

      Want to re-generate the master 'known good' files?
      ..................................................

      Simple.

        cd tests && rm -rf ref/

      and you got rid of them all. Next, run

        make check

      as usual and you'll get a warning for every missing reference
      file, which will be automatically generated. Though, of course,
      I'd rather see you just 'rm -f'-d only those ref/ files that need
      updating...

    * TODO: tests/Makefile.am cleanup: now some of those lines are
            _extremely_ large; these may be broken into readable bits.

    * Removed old crufftiness in classifiers:

        i = 0;
        while (htext[i] < 0x021)
            i++;
        CRM_ASSERT(i < hlen);
        j = i;
        while (htext[j] >= 0x021)
            j++;

      Now only the new crm_nextword() repalacement calls remain in the
      code.

    * Code Cleanup: checked all heap allocation calls and made sure
                    return values are checked for undesirable NULL
                    pointers.

                    This should later be migrated to a CRM114 equivalent
                    of GNUlib xmalloc() et al - but this time with the
                    option to pass along a customized error message to
                    provide the user with more information when such a
                    thing happens.

                  + crm_nextword() calls are now all properly checked
                    for their success/fail return code, instead of the
                    previous situation: mostly no check at all,
                    sometimes on return code, sometimes a check on the
                    side effect that the returned length will be zero.

                    Some of the superfluous length checks still remain,
                    e.g.

                        if (crm_nextword(htext,
                                hlen, fn_start_here,
                                &fnstart, &fnlen)
                                && fnlen > 0)
                        {

                    where this suffices completely and utterly:

                        if (crm_nextword(htext,
                                hlen, fn_start_here,
                                &fnstart, &fnlen))
                        {

                    as crm_nextword() will not return zero-length tokens
                    as 'valid' items.

    * Code Cleanup / Security Fixes for potential out-of-bounds
      accesses:

      - crm_nextword()can always report there's not more tokens to have
        (fail return code); several spots in the code did not explicitly
        take care of this situation, some obviouslt assuming 'nothing
        can go wrong here'. Right.

        The complete code has been inspected for this flaw and when
        found, it has been fixed.

      - This three line pattern which appears throughout the code is a
        potential security hazard:

            crm_get_pgm_arg(htext, htext_maxlen, apb->p1start, apb->p1len);
            hlen = apb->p1len;
            hlen = crm_nexpandvar(htext, hlen, htext_maxlen);

        as the actual produce of crm_get_pgm_arg() does not HAVE to be
        apb->p1len (4th arg) characters. This can happen when working
        with very large strings which do not fit in MAX_PATTERN,
        MAX_FILE_NAME_LEN or other pattern buffer sizes used in the
        code.

        Unfortunately crm_get_pgm_arg() was a void function so the
        caller would not hear about the actual length of the buffer
        returned by this routine. Hence the call now has an 'int' return
        type and returns the actual number of characters written to the
        pattern buffer.

        This means the subsequent crm_nexpandvar() call does not run the
        risk anymore of processing to much input which it must believe
        is legal data.

        The new coding pattern looks like this:

            hlen = crm_get_pgm_arg(htext, htext_maxlen, apb->p1start, apb->p1len);
            hlen = crm_nexpandvar(htext, hlen, htext_maxlen);

        and has been applied throughout the code: all source code has
        been reviewed for this issue.

        The same goes for the

            hlen = crm_get_pgm_arg(htext, htext_maxlen, apb->p1start, apb->p1len);
            hlen = crm_restrictvar(...

        sequence, by the way...

      - A related issue is that callers of crm_nexpandvar() quite often
        write an extra NUL byte into the buffer at - matching the sample
        shown above:

              htext[hlen] = 0;

        This happens either directly (shortly afterwards in the code) or
        indirectly (through one or more crm_nextword() calls which point
        at a part of the buffer, after which the NUL byte is written at
        the length position returned by the crm_nextword() call.

        Both situations will cause an out-of-bounds write operation,
        which will corrupt your data/stack, when working with very large
        strings and variable names. I'm sure variable names of ~ 2046
        characters (excluding the two ':' delimiting colons) can be made
        to cause this issue; of course it not 'average day use' but
        security risks are by definition situations which MAY cause
        trouble, and here we have one such situation.

        The code has been reviewed for this issue and a multitude of
        places were this applies were located. Due to the amount of
        effort required to fix this in the callers itself, it is now
        officially assumed that

          crm_nexpandvar() will be used in situations where the returned
          length will be used by the caller to write an _extra_ sentinel
          byte to the buffer.

          To ensure that the caller can do so legally, crm_nexpandvar()
          will AT ALL TIMES return a length of no more than the maximum
          buffer width passed to it MINUS ONE. This rule applies even
          under the harshest error conditions inside crm_expandvar()

        That means that this call

             hlen = crm_nexpandvar(htext, hlen, MAX_PATTERN);

        will never fail this subsequent assertion:

             CRM_ASSERT(hlen >= 0 && hlen <= MAX_PATTERN-1);

        so that a subsequent line like this:

             htext[hlen] = 0;

        is LEGAL from now on.

        The impact is that variable names and other text segments are
        now limited to one character less in size, but at 2-16K limits
        this is very acceptable.

      ALSO, several code sections calling crm_expandvar() assumed it
        would write such a NUL sentinel itself; to prevent other odd
        behaviour inside the expandvar() code, this is not more so
        anymore; besides, the old code did not do it either under
        erroneous conditions, so there was no guarantee at all the NUL
        sentinal would be there when the crm_expandvar() call was done.


        The complete source code has been inspected for these issues and
        all locations have been fixed/updated to show this behaviour
        consistently. THE ONLY THING we did NOT do EVERYWHERE is add
        that NUL-sentinel anyhow: only the code sections that seem to
        require this NUL sentinel have been updated, if the sentinel
        wasn't yet written by the calling code, due to the incorrect
        assumption mentioned in the previous paragraph.

      - Multiple locations where script variables and buffer were
        copied/loaded, no length check was performed, so invalid results
        would be generated for extremely large variable names, which are
        longer than the compile-time defined sizes.

        Now many places in the code have added boundary checking and
        additional error messages to report this type of situation back
        to the user.

        TODO: inspect the complete source code for this issue and fix
        accordingly. Now several boundaries seem to be silently applied:
        no crash, indeed but still behaviour based on partial (stripped)
        inputs and no failure notices for the user.

    * 'crm114 -v' now also prints the revision number for proper version
      checking.

    * SCRIPT: fixed :@: integer printing: now integer are always printed
      without any trailing decimal part a la floating point values.

    * Significantly reduced the number of annoying warnings on Win32/64
      by casting size_t returning functions to (int) where applicable.

    * The script compiler now adds a reference to the command definition
      record for each JIT/compiled command, so other code (debugger!)
      may reference this extra info.

    * COLOPHON.txt fixed (Debian bug #471554: typo in COLOPHON.txt)

    * Vector Tokenizer changes to allow full custom 3D vector matrices;
      also refactored to permit the use of custom tokenizer functions, etc.


2008-03-31 Ger Hobbelt

    * Fixes in -err/-out handling; also fixed the 'output' script
      command:

        output [stderr]

      will _still_ go to the '-err filename' redirected stderr, just
      like it would when you'd called crm114 using

        crm114 .... 2> filename

      instead.

    * Fixes in the 'updated' crm114 parser/compiler to properly run
      mailreaver.crm et al again.

    * Added stricter checks (now checks at all ;-) ) in the compiler:
      decoded flags in <arg> element are checked against the predefined
      allowed flag set (in crm_compiler.c). If any flag is NOT in the
      allowed set, an error will be reported.

      This resulted in a significant update of the stmt_table[] flag set
      definitions for each command to match the rest of the code.

      QUICKREF.txt has been updated too in several places to mimic
      these.

    * mailreaver et al contained a few \: escapes in their trap handlers
      which shouldn't be there. Removed.

    * fixed the fault/trap handlers: now the offending source line
      itself is included in the error report.

      Yes, this is a kinda kludgy fix for another nasty issue: the line
      numbers reported by CRM14 are 'nearby' at best, due to the fact
      that the [errorhandling] code is not aware of the modifications
      performed by the preprocessor: line breaking, 'insert' processing,
      line merging ('\' continuation char at end of line pulls next line
      up). In fact, the code does NEVER track 'original source
      line/position/filename' info for the script sources. This also
      means that 'insert' will cause crm14 to report some really fancy
      linenumbers in the _main_ source file when the offending line is
      in the insert-ed code or follows that 'insert' statement in the
      main source file.

      This will not be fixed until we introduce 'sourceinfo' tracking
      code which 'remembers' where the source code came from on a per-
      char basis: filename/line/position -- remember the preprocessor
      does line breaking, triggered by comments, semicolons and the
      recognition of another 'token' outside []()//<> braces anyway!

    * Fixed a nonfatal OSB Bayes file access failure report:

      WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

      The complete code should be inspected to

      (a) determine which errors are _really_ fatal, as the code is
          littered with fatalerror()s which at least look like they're
          not all that fatal anyhow: nothing a trap handler in the
          script can't handle.

      (b) nonfatalerror()s should probably abort the current command.

      An example for (b) which was changed in the code: when one of the
      CSS databases cannot be opened for some reason, the classify run
      should be aborted immediately, because that file will be lacking
      from the evaluation, thus - at the very least - inadvertentedly
      skewing the pR results to numbers which might lead to wrong
      conclusions.

      In this particular case, the good.css was missing, but the code
      continued on, was _lucky_ to find spam.css was also lacking, or
      spam.css would've been used to find the 'good guys' this way. This
      is not a severe issue for classify calls which include only 2
      files - though the validation for this is also lacking, so you
      still get weird results at times - but it is harder to tolerate
      when the classify should run across multiple CSS files: if one is
      missing from the action for some reason, the 'pR' output cannot be
      trusted.

      Hence, such nonfatalerror() issues should abort the command by
      returning to caller immediately.


      GROT GROT GROT: Currently there's also been [almost] no checking
                      if all memory and handles are correctly
                      freed/released when aborting a command due to a
                      nonfatalerror().


2008-03-26 Ger Hobbelt

    * updated to Bill's latest release (20080326)

    * fixed a dumb mistake in crmregex_tre.c which I'd introduced myself
      :-(


2008-03-25 Ger Hobbelt

    * 'int'ified ('INTifada') crm114 sources - finally got fed up and
      killed the 'long' fetish.

      INTifada: 'long' fetish has been removed from the code: now
      everything is an 'int' like every good boy should, unless it
      specifically NEEDS to be something else.

      Process to redo this in a blunt way (I did it the hard way:
      partial code inspection):

        convert 'long long' to int64_t and unsigned long long to
        uint64_t

        find timing code and make sure those clock_t derivatives are
        'clock_t' instead of long

          s/\<long\>/int/g

    * Added fwrite_ASCII_Cfied() routine to report variables, etc. to
      stderr/stdout, so non-ascii variables, mucked up scripts, etc.
      don't get a chance to blow up the console anymore.

    * Merged latest Neural Net code

    * Bugfixes in the crm language parser (variable hash storage)

    * Language parser could not cope with the line

        alius   # line comment

      Nor would it handle

        # urgh \# alius

      correctly by processing - you wish - the 'alius' opcode in there.

      The new code can cope with series of comments and inter-command
      comments like these lines:

        # so? \#  output  # what? \#/checking for a foo.../#if we mingle comments with code? \# # like this?

      See alius_w_comment.crm for a few test cases.

    * Bugfix in 'file1 | file2 | file3' regexes in SKS and SVM: now
      correctly copes with megatest.sh's

        ./crm114 '-{window; learn ( i_test.css | q_test.css| i_vs_q_test.css ) < svm unigram unique > /[[:graph:]]+/ /0 0 100 1e-3 1 0.5 1 1/ }'

      Note that 'q_test.css|' in there: file2 will be decoded by the old
      regex, but no match for file3 as the relevant part of the old
      regex said:

        [[:space:]]+\\|[[:space:]]+([[:graph:]]+)

      Note the '+'-es in there following those [[:space:]] classes.



2008-03-24 Ger Hobbelt

    * Latest gcc versions recognize and handle trigraphs like you'd
      expect ;-) so all "???" sequences have been converted to "\?\?\?"
      to keep GCC and other compilers from unintentionally recognizing a
      trigraph there.

    * added second // slash arg to the CRM 'syscall' cvommand to specify
      alternative commands for other OS-es. This is intended to allow
      CRM114 and CRM script writers to cope with the absolutely NON-
      portable syscall operation: this is only portable across UNIX
      boxes - and then only to a degree.

      So the second slash arg has format:

        /[hoststring]commandline/

      where 'hoststring' is the compile-time HOSTTYPE string, which, for
      example, for the Win32 builds is 'Windows-MS'. BTW: hoststring-
      comparison is caseINSENSITIVE.

      The square brackets are used to delimit the hoststring, so when
      the 'hoststring' matches the compile-time constant in your CRM114
      binary, the 'commandline' will be used to replace the commandline
      as specified in the first // slash arg.

      See randomiotest.crm for an example.

    * Fixed OSBF/OSB/Markovian classify code when too many CSS databases
      to use for classification have been specified - this prevents an
      array-overrun & out-of-bounds memory access.

    * Got fed up with the minor differences between Win32 and UNIX
      megatest: created a copy in megatest_ng.sh, which should produce
      indentical results to megatest.sh, but uses input files (*.input)
      instead of the UNIX shell <<-EOF...EOF code.

      This is mirrored in the new megatest.bat, which can thus use the
      same input files; I've found that the difference between a LF or
      CRLF line termination byte sequence does lead to some significant
      differences in the test results.

    * Major fixes to the Win32 syscall command; now

        exectest.crm

      does actually run on Win32. Please note that UNIX commands still
      won't work allow of a sudden on a Win32 box - unless you provide
      the proper binaries and environment - but at least vanilla
      syscall, syscall <keep> and even syscall <async> now work async
      expected: no crash or indefinite lockup anymore!

      Note that this still applies:
        "Sorry, syscall to a label isn't implemented in this version "

    * Adapted error reporting to match Bill's code. See the

        bill_style_errormessage

      constant in crm_[util_]errorhandlers.c - maybe we'll make this
      run-time configurable one day, instead of compile-time like it is
      today...

      Bill's format puts the code info at the end, instead of at the
      start, and looks like this:

         (runtime system location: crm_expr_file_io.c(151) in routine: crm_expr_input)

    * Win32 megatest now tests OK for these classifiers (run

        ( megatest.bat 2 2>&1 ) > megatest_win32.log

      in a DOS box to verify):

          ****  Default (SBPH Markovian) classifier
          **** OSB Markovian classifier

                WARNING: there's a VT bug in the 20080324 wget copy of
                         CRM114, which reflects on the knowngood: it is
                         NOT good in that regard. The GerH builds
                         includes the fixes, but will differ from
                         knowngood until the base has been fixed too.

          **** OSB three-letter Hyperspace classifier     <-- as above
          **** Unigram Hyperspace classifier              <-- as above
          **** String Hyperspace classifier               <-- as above
          **** String Unigram Hyperspace classifier       <-- as above
          **** Vector 3-word-bag Hyperspace classifier    <-- as above
          **** Bit-Entropy classifier        <-- entropy numbers differ 0.00001 percent at most.
                                                 Which might be considered excellent.
          **** Fast Substring Compression Match Classifier
          **** Bytewise Correlation classifier            <--- turned out A-OK, when I finally discovered that fixing typo's etc
                                                               in documents does NOT help megatest.sh to produce identical
                                                               results. I'm a dunce.


      dubious:

          **** Bit-Entropy Toroid classifier  <-- 10% difference in pR and slight difference in jump counts. Cause yet unknown.

          **** Support Vector Machine (SVM) unigram classifier  <-- passes the test with 0.2% difference in pR tops,
                                                                    but yaks about some files in certain tests,
                                                                    due to tightened error checking in GerH.
                                                                    A 'hm'.
          **** Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier          <-- as above. Another 'hm'.
          **** String Kernel SVM (SKS) classifier
          **** String Kernel SVM (SKS) Unique classifier        (maybe a bug in megatest_ng.sh ??? )


      dangerous:

          **** Neural Network Classifier     <-- crashes; feature counts which differ wildly between 64-bit UNIX,
                                                 knowngood and Win32.

          **** Clump / Pmulc Test            <-- if you like wierd crashes and code which shouldn't have worked in the first
                                                 place...


      Meanwhile

              echo === TEST 014 ===
              .\crm114 matchtest.crm  < matchtest_mt_ng_1.input

      still needs some medical attention IMHO, as CRM114 on Win32 is
      much more 'picky' about whitespace than its UNIX brethren.  Why?
      Don't know yet. But it shown in line leading and trailing
      whitespace sometimes.

      Probably due to the clunky whitespace skip loops in the CRM114
      code.


    * UNIX / GNU make now comes with a working 'test' target, which
      actually uses the new megatest_ng.sh New Generation ;-) shell
      script. As before, a diff with Bill's knowngood is provided when
      done. so now you can

        make test

      like everybody else out there!

    * Included VT and other fixes reported in the CRM114 ML these last
      few days:

         Hyperspace featurecounts Fixed

         TRE interface/regex cache fixed (Paolo) -- I discarded my older fix,
                                                    because I have not been able
                                                    to guarantee that it
                                                    would've worked, where
                                                    Paolo's does - has been
                                                    tested on a victim.

    * Updated and reformatted (indent cleanup) QUICKREF.txt.

    * QUICKREF.txt now includes preliminary documentation for the new
      CRM statements:

        cssanalyze <flags> (:report:) (:c1:) /params/
        cssbackup <flags> (:report:) (:dst: :c1:) /params/
        csscreate <flags> (:report:) (:c1:) /params/
        cssdiff <flags> (:report:) (:c1: :c2:) /params/
        cssinfo <flags> (:report:) (:c1:) /params/
        cssmerge <flags> (:report:) (destfile) (:c1:...:cN:) /params/
        cssrestore <flags> (:report:) (:c1: :src:) /params/

      These are intended to obsolete the external css* tools in due time
      and should be able to handle each classifier (see the bottom of
      classifier sources for the preliminary hooks/code).


2008-01-28 Ger Hobbelt

  * (BillY) Added VT (Vector Tokenization) to the Hyperspace classifier. The
    others will follow its lead in this.

  * Included qsort implementation by Michael Tokarev
    (http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/qsort.html) for a bit of improved performance as
    suggested by Paolo.

  * Fixed Makefile.am so standard ./bootstrap script works as expected,
    including 'make distcheck': that one doesn't fail anymore.

  * Included the original BillY makefile in src/: it is minimally patched to
    make it behave as expected with the new GNU/autoconf enabled code in here.

    For those who like to compile this thing the old fashioned way on compatible
    systems, please run

      cd src
      ./make_vanilla_UNIX.sh
      ./make_vanilla_UNIX.sh megatest

    as a replacement for the old BillY make action:

      cd src
      make
      make megatest

    i.e. replace 'make' in Bill's documents with make_vanilla_UNIX.sh if you want to go
    down that road (you'll miss out on all the ./configure goodness though ;-) ).

    Note that a special configuration headerfile (src/config_vanilla_UNIX_sys_defaults.h) is
    provided to help make_BillY compile on compatible UNIX systems. This
    headerfile includes a toned down UNIX build configuration. Tested on SuSE
    Linux, but should (hopefully) build on other UNIXes as well. If any compile
    time errors occur here, please edit the src/config_vanilla_UNIX_sys_defaults.h headerfile
    according and please post the diffs/changes to the crm developer mailing
    list.

    WARNING: src/make_vanilla_UNIX.sh et al are provided as a 'backwards compatible
        build fix' ONLY and are NOT meant to replace the available ./configure-
        driven build/install available in this or future GerXXXX crm
        distro/builds!

        * Made initial provisions to merge the crm tools with crm itself: added
          the statements cssmerge / cssdiff / cssinfo / cssanalyze / cssbackup /
          cssrestore / csscreate.

          These statements should suffice to cover the functionality found in
          the cssutil / osbf_util / cssmerge / cssdiff tools.

        * Improved the indent.sh shell script and src/Makefile a bit; the
          included uncrustify.cfg config file is compatible with the latest
          uncrustify version today (jan/2008): v0.42

        * KNOWN BUG: 'make reindent': uncrustify will not format the last few
                     lines of crm_mjt_qsort.h in a suitable layout. The code
                     will compile, but correct this one by hand to undo the
                     damage there (until I find what's wrong with uncrustify :-(
                     ).

  * KNOWN BUG for clump/pmulc still applies! :-(
